# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project follows a simple changelog format:

- `Added` for new capabilities
- `Changed` for updates to existing behavior or documentation
- `Fixed` for corrections
- `Removed` for deprecated or deleted behavior

## Unreleased

- Changed the local web provider and model experience: connection scope is inferred from a validated loopback/private-LAN IP, each text capability remembers its own model, and the balanced default keeps one active model warm for five idle minutes while preserving explicit cleanup on New task, model/provider changes, failures, and shutdown.
- Added repository-free Writing and Summarization modes to the loopback-only web application. All three text modes use exact admitted capability IDs, bounded in-memory inputs, typed chat or Markdown results, and verified model unload without filesystem or repository access.
- Added the first runnable Haven 42 product slice: a zero-new-dependency, loopback-only local web application with sanitized system status, explicit loopback/trusted-LAN Ollama validation, installed-model selection, bounded private chat, cross-origin defenses, session-only state, and verified unload after success, failure, and shutdown.
- Fixed native Bash testing on Windows by securely resolving an installed Python 3 exposed as `python`, `python.exe`, or `py -3`, validating its major version, and activating a fail-closed `python3` compatibility launcher for child shell scripts without installing software or permanently changing the machine `PATH`.
- Added a cross-platform, read-only security-aware model catalog that combines bounded discovery records, immutable artifact identity, fail-closed per-artifact license policy, hardware fit, and revision-bound validation evidence into shared beginner and advanced product decisions without downloading models, executing remote code, or changing runtime configuration.
- Added eight capability-specific onboarding setting schemas plus a renderer-independent default-deny evaluator. Structured advanced settings may preserve, narrow, or block evidence but cannot forge validation, approval, commands, raw endpoints, paths, or credentials; hostile tests verify zero machine effects, strict trusted-admission shape, and sanitized decisions.
- Removed rename-era identity language so tracked product documentation, prompts, tests, packages, and wiki content use only the Haven 42 name and canonical repository identity.
- Added a product-wide progressive onboarding contract for chat, agents, generative media, models, engines, connections, storage, and updates: every configurable area offers guided setup, existing setup, and not-now; both active paths expose structured advanced controls; and the engine derives validated, customized, unverified, or blocked without admitting runtime behavior.
- Expanded the exact Windows AMD ComfyUI/SDXL partial evidence with repeated-run timing, active cancellation, invalid-workflow recovery, forced process recovery, post-restart adapter success, metadata and signal inspection, retention cleanup, and complete disposable uninstall. Promotion remains blocked because no newer immutable AMD release exists for a real update/rollback test and consumer onboarding/installer behavior remains unadmitted; no Windows runtime, installer, or test harness ships.
- Rechecked the official Tauri release, crates.io, and npm registries; the reviewed `urlpattern 0.6` fix remains unpublished, so runtime admission stays blocked. Added a 55-case native-authority policy model for path grants, external links, approvals, sidecar lifecycle, cancellation, environment filtering, and privilege rejection without adding Tauri or runtime files.
- Defined the first Haven 42 product UI slice with first-run, Home, Chat, Software, Images, Models, System, approval, progress, and result wireframes; added a fail-closed registry-backed view-model builder that exposes no commands, endpoints, tokens, or execution authority while desktop runtime admission remains blocked.
- Promoted the llama.cpp local-text adapter to live-validated for its exact Linux NVIDIA/CUDA profile after pinned-server discovery, exact-profile admission, OpenAI-compatible invocation, exact-output, sanitization, GPU-use, timing, shutdown, and disposable-environment cleanup passed; Windows AMD/HIP remains engine-evidence-only.
- Added a cross-platform offline core-update policy with strict immutable-release, compatibility, host-asset, approved-host, byte-size, and SHA-256 validation. It explicitly cannot use the network, write, download, stage, attest, activate, or touch user data.
- Expanded the desktop sidecar policy self-test to 46 hostile cases covering nested execution fields, grant types and duplication, approval session binding, inactive cancellation, event binding, and terminal-event completeness while keeping native bridge gates open.
- Rechecked the published desktop dependency candidates; Tauri 2.11.5 remains the latest crate/release and does not contain the reviewed upstream fix, so runtime admission remains blocked.
- Generalized local text discovery and execution across Ollama and OpenAI-compatible llama.cpp contracts, with backward-compatible Ollama arguments, exact engine/backend/hardware admission, no silent fallback, normalized typed artifacts, endpoint sanitization, and Windows plus shared Linux/macOS fail-closed tests.
- Added a fail-closed inference-engine registry and exact llama.cpp evidence: CUDA passed on Linux NVIDIA RTX 5000 and HIP passed on Windows AMD, while failed Vulkan remains documentation-only, Intel paths remain parked, IPEX-LLM is retired, and LM Studio is optional API-only software.
- Added fail-closed, consent-driven consumer-local image-provider onboarding with exact OS/accelerator evidence boundaries and no candidate installer admission.
- Recorded immutable documentation-only ACE-Step, Stable Audio, HunyuanVideo, Wan2.2, and LTX-2.3 candidate identities, sizes, checksums, licenses, claimed operations, and unresolved gates.
- Added a shared generative-media consent policy for reference media, voice and likeness, lyrics and style requests, attribution, commercial use, disclosure, retention, and cleanup.
- Added versioned quantization plan/artifact contracts, an explicit format/runtime support matrix, OS-aware sanitized hardware profiling, dry-run trusted-artifact selection, disclosures, and comparative promotion gates without adding a conversion path.
- Defined cross-platform desktop storage ownership and a strict signed immutable-release update/rollback manifest contract without admitting an updater or runtime scaffold.
- Recorded a successful controlled-source Windows x64 Tauri native-build probe for the upstream `urlpattern 0.6` fix while keeping the unpublished dependency and all runtime files blocked from shipment.
- Added a standard-library desktop sidecar IPC admission policy with hostile offline tests while leaving native bridge and lifecycle gates explicitly open.

- Added timed Fast, Integration, and Full test tiers, removed duplicate hosted validation steps, and added exact-clean-tree Full-test receipts so pre-push can skip only an identical local rerun while GitHub remains authoritative.
- Replaced family-bound Ollama-only discovery with a source-neutral schema and shared engine supporting independent Ollama and Hugging Face queries, immutable revisions, license and gated metadata, formats, quantization signals, runtime candidates, and candidate-only trust gates.
- Recorded the disposable Windows x64 desktop dependency resolution: npm and PyInstaller graphs passed integrity, license, installation, and vulnerability checks, while Windows-reachable unmaintained Rust crates, Linux-only GTK3/glib findings, audit-tool provenance, and the unrun native Tauri build blocked runtime admission.
- Pinned the direct Milestone 22 desktop dependency candidates without adding runtime manifests, and documented their licenses, platform prerequisites, supply-chain gates, excluded packages, and re-evaluation triggers.
- Added schema-v1 private desktop IPC and default-deny Tauri authority contracts covering registered operations, native path grants, effect-bound approvals, strict events, local content, sidecar lifecycle, privacy, and required negative tests.
- Normalized Python CRLF output at the shared Bash installer boundary so Git Bash on Windows activates the intended rule-pack filename instead of creating a carriage-return-suffixed path.
- Selected Tauri 2 with bundled React/TypeScript/Vite assets and a packaged Haven 42 engine sidecar as the Milestone 22 desktop boundary; ordinary desktop operation uses private typed stdin/stdout IPC with no generic shell bridge or listening port, while hardened loopback mode remains separately gated for headless use.
- Defined cross-platform package and signing policy: unsigned development builds, GitHub-hosted platform builds, free Windows signing paths before paid Artifact Signing, Apple enrollment deferred until the first public macOS beta, signed/notarized public macOS packages, signed public Windows packages, attested Linux artifacts, and a final physical-Mac release gate.
- Made hosted CI authentication preflight advisory when exact public run APIs remain queryable; repository and exact-SHA run access still fail closed when the authoritative API request is unavailable.
- Renamed the product to Haven 42 with the tagline "Your private, local AI station," and adopted the `haven-42` identity across the repository, release artifacts, product-specific workflows, scripts, paths, and documentation before external adoption.
- Refreshed the README and wiki landing page to reflect the provider-neutral local AI workbench direction, current maintained surfaces, validated general text and Linux image capabilities, pass-before-ship model, and Milestones 22 through 25 without prematurely renaming the repository.
- Added and live-validated the session-bound local Ollama text adapter for bounded chat, writing, and summarization with explicit execute/apply gates, typed artifacts, sanitization, cleanup, and no repository reads.
- Added a cross-platform, repository-optional general AI session command with deterministic first-run capability menu, dry-run-first workspace planning, explicit effect disclosures, safe local metadata, and no automatic capability invocation.
- Added offline-first capability availability discovery and deterministic engineering workflow route plans with explicit probing, no endpoint persistence, no automatic invocation, and Windows, Linux, and macOS entry points.
- Added an optional dry-run-first LLM intent suggestion layer with structured output, committed-registry validation, unknown-ID rejection, policy disclosure, and no automatic invocation.
- Added a live-validated, session-bound local ComfyUI image adapter with a built-in SDXL workflow, typed PNG artifacts, metadata and history privacy checks, explicit provider-retention disclosure, and OS-aware entry points.
- Added a reproducible ComfyUI Linux provider setup runbook covering hardware inventory, non-root SSH access, pinned installation, CUDA compatibility, checkpoint verification, hardened systemd service, SSH tunneling, adapter validation, upgrades, and rollback.
- Added native consumer image-provider candidates for Windows NVIDIA CUDA, Windows Intel GPU/XPU, Windows AMD GPU, and Apple Silicon MPS, with independent pass-before-ship gates and no external-server requirement.
- Added a documentation-only local music and audio roadmap covering ACE-Step 1.5, Stable Audio 3.0, YuE, and MusicGen; native accelerator profiles, licensing, consent, typed audio, privacy, recovery, and pass-before-ship gates remain required before executable integration.
- Added a Milestone 22 core-engine auto-update roadmap using immutable GitHub Releases, verified platform assets, compatibility preflight, atomic activation, health checks, rollback, user-state separation, offline operation, and explicit automatic-install consent.
- Promoted native local image generation into visible Milestone 23 with the Linux ComfyUI/SDXL baseline marked validated, renumbered local music/audio to Milestone 24, and added documentation-only Milestone 25 for HunyuanVideo 1.5, Wan2.2, and LTX-2.3 video candidates.
- Added Milestone 21 capability and typed-artifact contracts plus deterministic non-LLM routing on Windows, Linux, and macOS; provider-backed general capabilities remain configuration-required and routing never auto-invokes actions.
- Realigned the roadmap dependency order: Milestone 20 is complete as the workflow and automation foundation, Milestone 21 owns general-purpose capability and routing contracts, and new Milestone 22 owns the unified UI and later multi-step composition.
- Added deterministic cross-platform wiki synchronization, generated navigation, retired-page cleanup, and a required hosted wiki freshness gate so mapped wiki documentation stays aligned with the repository.
- Adopted a pass-to-ship admission policy for agent software: candidate evaluations stay disposable and untracked, successful integrations must pass all promotion and cross-platform gates before repository admission, and failed evaluations produce documentation only with no retained operational artifacts.
- Removed retired Roo Code wrappers and active metadata so the repository immediately conforms to the new admission policy.
- Removed all Cline and Kilo scripts, adapters, active catalog entries, detailed evidence files, and restoration backlog after both integrations failed required promotion gates; the maintained surface set is now Continue, Aider, and OpenCode.
- Strengthened the OpenHands isolation contract and completed Milestones 17 and 19 for the promoted supported-surface set.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-21

- Added roadmap and UI architecture for a repository-optional general-purpose AI assistant, including a provider-neutral capability layer, deterministic and optional LLM intent routing, typed artifacts, chat and image modalities, and policy enforcement outside model prompts.
- Advanced the release line to `0.3.0` after the accumulated non-breaking workflow, adapter, cross-platform, validation, and product-scope additions since `v0.2.0`.

- Recorded current Kilo CLI 7.4.11 Windows evidence: Devstral read-only passed while its write/scoped gates failed, and Qwen 3.5 35B failed all gates; strengthened the shared PowerShell and Unix harnesses to return nonzero when any requested validation gate fails despite a surface phase exiting zero.

- Hardened the Cline CLI model harness with per-model system-temporary profiles, explicit workspace anchoring, a realistic scoped source-and-test edit mode, exact changed-file and unexpected-file checks, dependency-free behavior verification, whitespace and LF-only validation, cleanup, and sanitized failure signals on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Recorded the hardened Cline rerun: read-only passed, while the scoped edit was correctly rejected for incomplete source/test scope, dirty whitespace, and non-LF output; fixture restoration, temporary-profile cleanup, and model unload passed.
- Compared Devstral Small 2 24B and Qwen 3 Coder 30B through Cline CLI 3.0.46 on Windows: both produced non-LF source edits that failed whitespace validation, while Qwen also failed grounded read and scoped behavior gates; further Windows scoped-edit promotion is blocked pending a relevant Cline fix or upgrade.

- Recorded Cline CLI 3.0.46 realistic scoped-edit evidence: exact file scope and behavior passed with Devstral Small 2 24B, but mixed line endings failed whitespace validation, so scoped-edit promotion remains blocked; documented use of system-temporary isolated state to avoid synchronized-workspace session collisions.

- Added shared OS-aware PowerShell command resolution for native executables, Windows npm `.cmd` shims, and standalone `.ps1` scripts; applied it across Cline, shared agent, Continue, runtime-policy, and language-matrix process harnesses.
- Added workflow entry-point and portable-template regression tests covering Windows, Linux, and macOS, plus explicit OS-selection rules and compatibility guidance.

- Added bounded Apple Silicon MLX validation evidence for the smaller Qwen 3.5 4B model, including structured tool, Continue CLI read, and disposable scoped-write checks.

- Added OpenAI-compatible local-endpoint support to the native language workflow matrix runner, including MLX health checks and explicit externally managed server unload behavior.
- Made the native language workflow matrix locate Homebrew `npx` in non-interactive macOS sessions, preventing a missing-PATH failure on prepared Mac hosts.

- Added a second successful Apple Silicon MLX Qwen 3.5 9B quantization validation and recorded the Devstral Small 2 24B MLX structured-tool-call failure as candidate-only evidence.

- Added an opt-in macOS MLX bootstrap path using a pack-managed Python 3.12 virtual environment, including safe migration of incompatible older MLX environments.
- Added native Apple Silicon MLX evidence for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and bounded Continue CLI read, plan, review, and disposable scoped-write smoke workflows.
- Added CI-enforced syntax and help-surface validation for every native macOS wrapper.

- Added medium-complexity Python, TypeScript, and polyglot language fixtures plus an evidence-gated validation matrix for repository discovery, planning, review, and scoped-write workflows.
- Added a deterministic Continue CLI matrix runner and recorded 19 of 28 validated medium-fixture workflow cells, with failed write and filename-fidelity cells preserved as blockers.
- Added cross-platform exact-SHA GitHub Actions verification with required Windows, Linux, and macOS job checks, automatic failed-log retrieval, and explicit push/CI reporting states.
- Added cross-platform, filename-only project classification with sanitized profile output and automatic project-local activation of matching optional language rule packs.
- Added the `classify-project` workflow registry entry and documented the project-neutral limitation of centralized shared-assets mode.
- Added lane-specific model scoring policy version 1 with exact capability-evidence gates, reliability-first WRITE SAFE selection, capacity-aware PLAN ONLY and DEEP REVIEW selection, and transparent per-candidate rationale.
- Added model-fit policy version 1 with curated quantization, weights, context-sensitive cache, runtime overhead, architecture, and memory-reserve assumptions plus cross-platform context/reserve overrides.
- Added a unified cross-platform agent-surface setup adapter with Aider install planning/execution, local-only Ollama config generation, health checks, workflow dispatch, and deterministic tests.
- Added schema-v1 workflow request and execution envelopes with cross-platform dispatcher parity, structured progress/warning/result/error events, and privacy-safe output defaults for future UI automation.
- Fixed malformed Windows paths in shared-assets documentation.
- Added Capability Evidence Contract v2 with surface-, version-, provider-, OS-, operation-, and validation-mode-specific keys.
- Migrated recommendation and scorecard consumers to conservative duplicate aggregation with retained provenance and no cross-surface write-readiness inheritance.
- Added Cline CLI model-test automation scripts and documentation for future read-only and disposable write-smoke screening.
- Added Continue CLI model-test automation scripts and documentation for CLI-first read-only and disposable write-smoke screening.

### Added

- Added shared agent operating contracts and read-only prompt execution contracts for permission boundaries, real tool invocation, untrusted repository content, failure reporting, and post-edit verification.


- Added sanitized Cline approved-write smoke-test evidence for a disposable generated Python sample, while keeping real-project approved-write blocked.

- Added deterministic filename-fidelity fallback artifacts for runtime validation workflows that fail with `FILENAME_NOT_IN_CONTEXT`.
- Added filename-fidelity gates to runtime review prompts and repository discovery so missing recommended files must be labeled instead of described as existing.
- Added runtime runner filename-fidelity instructions and regression coverage so model-backed validation receives the guardrail next to supplied context.
- Added sanitized filename-fidelity hardening rerun evidence for generated Java, Go, Rust, SQL, and Infrastructure workflow validation.
- Added sanitized Generated Java, Go, Rust, SQL, and Infrastructure workflow validation evidence, including empty-output and filename-drift guardrail signals.
- Added optional Java, Go, Rust, SQL, and Infrastructure as Code rule packs with static generated-sample validation evidence while keeping them out of the default config.

- Added non-.NET runtime context generation coverage for generated TypeScript, Node, Infrastructure as Code, and SQL samples.
- Added shared asset installation design guidance for future centralized prompts/rules/docs reuse across multiple target repositories.
- Added sanitized hardware-aware recommendation validation evidence for install, recommendation, local-only config generation, and API preflight.

- Added local-only Continue config generation from hardware-aware recommendation JSON.
- Added cross-platform release packaging scripts with archive, manifest, checksum, and install verification guidance.
- Added a sanitized evidence catalog for model, editor surface, language, sample repository, installer profile, and workflow validation status.
- Added installer profiles for default, read-only, and approved-write Continue workflows.
- Added an opt-in Git pre-push hook installer so pack validation catches shell executable-bit regressions before GitHub Actions.
- Added sanitized missing-model existence and API-level screening evidence, including `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q5_K_M` as an API-level candidate.
- Added sanitized candidate-model Continue CLI validation evidence for Qwen3-Coder-Next:latest and devstral-small-2:latest.
- Added sanitized model-backed workflow validation evidence for generated Python and TypeScript samples in `examples/multi-language-workflow-validation.md`.
- Added sanitized static generated-sample validation evidence for optional Python and TypeScript rule packs in `examples/language-rule-pack-validation.md`.
- Added optional Python and TypeScript rule packs under `.continue/rule-packs/` with evidence gates so they are not globally loaded by default.
- Added `docs/language-rule-packs.md` for optional language rule-pack selection, default config behavior, and validation expectations.
- Added `docs/project-detection.md` for evidence-based ecosystem, framework, build, package, and test-system classification before language-specific advice.
- Added focused Continue CLI repository-discovery validation evidence for generated Python and TypeScript samples after improving runtime context fidelity.
- Added sample repository factory documentation and scripts for disposable local validation repositories.
- Added sanitized sample repository factory validation evidence for generated Python and TypeScript samples.
- Added roadmap and TODO tracking for sample repository factory, agent-surface compatibility validation, language rule packs, installer profiles, evidence catalogs, and release packaging.

### Changed

- Fixed the native shell test harness so the workflow-envelope test is defined outside the Aider recommendation JSON heredoc, and made empty workflow argument dispatch compatible with macOS Bash 3.2.
- Consolidated beginner setup, agent menu, and workflow chooser plumbing behind a shared PowerShell module and native shell dispatcher while preserving all documented entry points.
- Added regression and validation coverage for the shared onboarding engines; full no-PowerShell Linux/macOS rendering remains explicitly tracked.
- Expanded Milestones 17 through 20 with ordered architecture work for surface-specific evidence, runtime language-rule activation, lane-specific model scoring, Aider adapter completion, versioned workflow envelopes, deeper validation, and UI gating.

- Scoped optional language packs and default .NET/ASP.NET rules with file globs, strengthened API and ASP.NET evidence gates, and added evidence-status fields to review templates.
- Updated prompt-quality, banned-output, language-pack, README, and cross-platform regression guidance to match the new contracts and current version.


- Updated runtime validation runners to fail fast with a sanitized local Ollama API preflight when local model servers are unreachable.
- Updated language support and rule-pack documentation to distinguish static generated-sample validation from editor/model workflow validation.
- Updated Python sample repository factory metadata to include `pyproject.toml` for stronger generated-sample validation.
- Updated core prompts, shared rules, and agents to evidence-gate language-specific recommendations and use `unconfirmed` when project metadata is missing.
- Improved runtime context generation so nested target folders do not inherit parent repository git status and common multi-language project metadata is included in context excerpts.

### Fixed

- Fixed runtime output verification so absent filenames are allowed only when clearly labeled as recommended new files or missing-file recommendations.
- Fixed runtime validation handling for empty model output so one empty response records EMPTY_MODEL_OUTPUT instead of aborting the run.

- Fixed hardware-aware config application so generated global Continue config uses absolute target repository file references and omits rules by default, preventing editor-install-folder prompt lookup failures.
- Fixed PowerShell sample repository factory README generation so Markdown command examples do not leak factory script text into generated samples.
- Added regression checks that generated sample README and source files do not contain factory script or here-string markers.

- Added installer support for explicitly updating the global Continue config with absolute references to a target repository's installed rules, prompts, and docs.
- Added platform-aware command guidance so Windows Agent workflows use PowerShell-native commands instead of Linux shell commands.

- Clarified that printed `edit_file` text without a real diff is `WRITE_NOT_APPLIED`.
- Clarified that validation status labels must not claim success when a failure signal is present.
- Added external shell and git verification requirements for approved-write validation so assistant-only readback cannot create false positive write passes.

- Added a post-validation model installer for applying a selected validated model to local-only Continue profile config.
- Added duplicate approval and duplicate content guidance for existing-file Continue Agent write validation.
- Added installer-supported model profiles for separating WRITE SAFE, PLAN ONLY, and DEEP REVIEW Agent roles while keeping embeddings separate.
- Added optional online Ollama model discovery guardrails that keep discovery candidate-only, explicit, non-installing, and separate from local validation.
- Added broader multi-repository validation guidance and a sanitized evidence template for future real-repository validation runs.

### Changed


- Expanded the project documentation beyond a Continue-only audience while keeping Continue as the first supported and validated agent surface.
- Changed generated model profiles to use `qwen3.5:9b` for WRITE SAFE, PLAN ONLY, and DEEP REVIEW by default so simple-hardware setups do not require 24B or 30B models.
- Tuned the committed local model defaults to `contextLength: 16384` and `maxTokens: 2048` after VS Code and VSCodium Agent testing showed better responsiveness with smaller local output budgets.
- Clarified approved write mode so models must use edit/apply tools after explicit approval or report that write tools are unavailable.
- Added `-GlobalConfigIncludeRules` and `--global-config-include-rules` for explicit global-only rule loading when needed.
- Added `READ_TOOLS_UNAVAILABLE` guidance for cases where the model can list files but cannot read the source or config files it wants to change.
- Added `WRITE_NOT_APPLIED` guidance for cases where the model claims an edit but the file content or git diff does not show it.
- Clarified that claimed file readback is not enough for approved-write readiness unless `git status` and shell file checks can see the change.
- Documented that automated local model preflight is candidate screening only and does not replace editor Apply validation.
