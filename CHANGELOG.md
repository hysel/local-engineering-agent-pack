## Unreleased

### Added

- Added Linux hardware profile platform notes for missing optional GPU detection tools and no-GPU detection fallbacks.
- Documented that CPU architecture is currently context for model selection, not a direct recommendation-tier input.
- Added a separate MLX model recommendation catalog and macOS MLX recommendation output for advanced Apple Silicon setups.
- Replaced Linux and macOS PowerShell-dependent wrappers with native Bash implementations for validation, tests, installation, runtime context generation, and runtime validation.
- Renamed shared Linux and macOS Bash implementation files to the `*.shared.sh` suffix to avoid implying support beyond Linux and macOS.
- Added Linux profile warnings and smoke-test guidance for enterprise/cloud images and container or LXC-style environments.
- Added editor compatibility guidance for VS Code, VSCodium, project-local configs, duplicate rules, Agent mode, and CLI fallback testing.
- Changed the committed Ollama model to a smaller starter sample and added install-script support for generating a local-only config from hardware profile recommendations.
- Added roadmap tracking for optional online Ollama model discovery as candidate-only, local-validation-required future work.
- Added model tool-use validation guidance and a sanitized evidence template for recording candidate, read-only validated, plan-validated, and approved-write-ready model status.
- Added sanitized editor-surface preflight evidence for local VS Code-compatible and VSCodium Continue extension detection, plus terminal preflight guidance.
- Recorded sanitized VS Code-compatible read-only Agent validation evidence with `qwen3-coder:30b` on an application-style sample repository.
- Recorded sanitized VSCodium Agent tool validation results, including an initial tool-call markup failure and a controlled read-only Agent retest that successfully listed repository files.
- Recorded clean duplicate-rule status for the current VS Code-compatible and VSCodium validation setup and closed Milestone 11 for the current scope.
- Added installer support for explicitly updating the global Continue config with absolute references to a target repository's installed rules, prompts, and docs.

### Fixed

- Fixed Linux and macOS installer wrapper executable permissions so direct shell execution works in CI and user terminals.

## 0.1.11 - 2026-07-03

### Added

- Added documentation explaining how hardware profile scripts choose model recommendations from the local Ollama model list and catalog order.
- Added configuration-pack review guardrails and a prompt-quality fixture for non-application repositories.
- Added sanitized runtime validation notes from a private .NET Framework Excel-DNA add-in repository.
- Added practical MCP workflow examples for read-only repository review, approved write mode, and release-readiness context gathering.

### Changed

- Reworked the README quick start to cover Windows, Linux, and macOS setup and validation paths.
- Added a README quick-start note explaining that model helper scripts use `config/model-recommendations.tsv`.
- Added README path-selection, day-to-day usage, safe first prompt, and common-problem guidance.
- Added README hardware expectation and do-not-commit safety guidance.
- Clarified the README quick-start config step so users know to use the project-local `.continue/config.yaml`.

### Fixed

- Fixed runtime validation config/context path handling so relative paths are resolved before the runner changes into the target repository.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added Linux and macOS validation/test wrapper scripts for contributors who prefer shell commands.
- Added CI coverage for Linux validation and test wrappers.
- Added sanitized runtime validation notes from pack repository self-validation.

## 0.1.9 - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Fixed validation path filtering so ignored local config files are handled correctly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Fixed runtime context path filtering so build output directories are excluded correctly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## 0.1.8 - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Fixed Linux and macOS hardware profile output so numeric GPU memory prints as `GB VRAM`.
- Fixed Linux and macOS hardware profile JSON so RAM and VRAM values are emitted as numbers, with unknown or shared memory emitted as `null`.
- Fixed Windows AMD GPU profiling by using `dxdiag` as a dedicated VRAM fallback before unreliable WMI adapter memory values.

### Added

- Added automated pack tests for validation behavior, local config safety, model recommendation catalog structure, and Continue file reference integrity.
- Added model recommendations to hardware profile scripts based on detected resource tier and installed Ollama models.
- Added a version-controlled model recommendation catalog that scripts can use for future model updates without changing script logic.
- Added local configuration safety guidance for keeping private endpoints, local paths, hardware output, and model experiments out of committed config.

- Changed the default chat/edit/apply model to `qwen3-coder:30b` after validation showed it supports Continue Agent tool execution more reliably than `qwen2.5-coder:7b`.
