## Milestone 12: Model Tool-Use Validation Evidence

Goal: Make model tool-use recommendations evidence-based instead of relying only on model names, hardware tier, or installed-model detection.

- Keep private endpoints, local paths, private repository names, and raw transcripts out of committed evidence.

Exit criteria:

- Users know that hardware/profile scripts recommend candidates, not proven tool-safe models.
- Online model discovery, if added, suggests candidates only and does not replace local validation or auto-install models.
