# Roadmap

## Status

The repository is in early implementation stage. The core documentation, configuration, agents, prompts, rules, templates, examples, and manual SonarQube workflow exist. The next goal is to harden enterprise review workflows with validation checklists and troubleshooting notes.

## Milestone 1: Minimum Usable Pack

Goal: Make the pack loadable, understandable, and useful for common enterprise engineering workflows.

Scope:

- Implement `.continue/config.yaml` for a basic Continue setup. Done.
- Define local-first model assumptions for Ollama. Done.
- Implement core rules. Done:
  - `general.md`
  - `git.md`
  - `dotnet.md`
  - `aspnetcore.md`
  - `clean-architecture.md`
  - `api.md`
  - `testing.md`
  - `logging.md`
  - `security.md`
  - `performance.md`
- Implement core prompts. Done:
  - `repository-discovery.md`
  - `implementation-plan.md`
  - `code-review.md`
  - `bug-investigation.md`
  - `security-review.md`
- Define primary agents. Done:
  - `senior-engineer.md`
  - `architect.md`
  - `security-engineer.md`
- Implement core templates. Done:
  - `Architecture.md`
  - `SecurityReview.md`
  - `PerformanceReview.md`
  - `AI.md`
- Update `README.md` with setup and usage instructions. Done.
- Statically validate local config file references. Done.
- Validate the pack in Continue CLI. Done.
- Validate model-backed prompt execution with Ollama. Done.
- Add example outputs for major workflows. Done.

Exit criteria:

- Continue can load the pack.
- A user can run repository discovery, implementation planning, code review, bug investigation, security review, architecture review, performance review, and documentation workflows.
- A user can run AI framework self-review, refactoring planning, product-management review, and release-readiness workflows.
- Rules and prompts are consistent with this repository's style guide.
- README instructions match tested behavior.

## Milestone 2: Enterprise Review Depth

Goal: Improve the quality and coverage of review workflows.

Scope:

- Add architecture review and performance review prompts. Done.
- Complete reviewer, performance, documentation, and product-manager agents. Done.
- Expand SonarQube guidance. Done.
- Add example review outputs. Done.
- Add validation checklists for prompt and rule changes.
- Add decision records for major design choices.

Exit criteria:

- Review outputs are consistent across architecture, security, code, and performance workflows.
- SonarQube findings can be incorporated manually in a documented way.
- The pack has examples that demonstrate expected usage.

## Milestone 3: Tooling And Integration

Goal: Connect the pack to richer repository and quality-system context.

Scope:

- Evaluate MCP servers for repository, filesystem, GitHub, issue tracking, and quality data.
- Define a supported MCP integration path.
- Explore SonarQube integration options.
- Add troubleshooting documentation.
- Add compatibility notes for Continue versions and local model choices.

Exit criteria:

- Integration paths are documented and reproducible.
- MCP support has clear setup instructions.
- SonarQube usage is no longer only conceptual.

## Backlog

- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file if outside contributors are expected.
- Add release tagging guidance.
- Add sample repositories or sample review fixtures.
- Add a validation script if Continue configuration checks can be automated.
- Choose and document a license.
