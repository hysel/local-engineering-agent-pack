# Aider Validation Evidence

This file records sanitized Aider validation evidence for this pack. It should not include private endpoints, local paths, usernames, raw transcripts, private repository names, customer names, or source code from private repositories.

## Current Status

Aider is currently a candidate agent surface. Model-backed read-only context validation, disposable write-smoke validation, and realistic scoped-edit validation have passed for `qwen3-coder:30b` against the generated Python sample. Real-project approved-write readiness is still blocked until validation passes in a realistic disposable application or an explicitly approved non-generated repository.

## Evidence: 2026-07-13 Read-Only Context Validation

### Summary

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Surface: Aider CLI
- Aider version: 0.86.2
- Operating system: Windows
- CPU architecture: x64
- Model: qwen3-coder:30b
- Provider: Ollama
- Target repository type: Python API sample
- Target repository source: generated disposable sample
- Tool/write mode: read-only file context
- Git status before test: clean
- Git status after test: clean
- Private details removed: Yes

### Tests

| Test | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only repository inspection | Pass | Aider received explicit read-only context for `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `app/main.py`, `app/settings.py`, and `tests/test_main.py`. |
| Unexpected file changes during read-only test | Pass | Verified outside Aider with Git; generated sample remained clean. |
| Disposable write smoke test | Not run | Still required before approved-write consideration. |
| External changed-file verification | Not run | Required for future write smoke validation. |
| Model unload after validation | Pass | The validation run used unload-after-each behavior and the Ollama process list was empty afterward. |

### Decision

- Validation level: read-only-context-validated
- Approved-write position: blocked pending disposable write-smoke and realistic scoped-edit validation
- Failure signals: none
- Follow-up: Run Aider disposable write-smoke validation against the generated Python sample after read-only evidence is reviewed.

## Evidence: 2026-07-13 Realistic Scoped-Edit Validation

### Summary

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Surface: Aider CLI
- Aider version: 0.86.2
- Operating system: Windows
- CPU architecture: x64
- Model: qwen3-coder:30b
- Provider: Ollama
- Target repository type: Python API sample
- Target repository source: generated disposable sample
- Tool/write mode: realistic scoped edit
- Git status before test: clean
- Git status after test: restored to clean
- Private details removed: Yes

### Tests

| Test | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scoped source/test edit | Pass | Aider updated only `app/settings.py`, `app/main.py`, and `tests/test_main.py`. |
| Unrelated file protection | Pass | README, sample metadata, project config, and other files were unchanged. |
| External changed-file verification | Pass | Git showed exactly the expected three changed files. |
| Whitespace verification | Pass after correction | Initial whole-file edit left one trailing-whitespace blank line; a follow-up Aider diff-format cleanup removed it and `git diff --check` passed. |
| Behavior verification | Pass | Direct Python checks validated default and overridden service-name responses. |
| Test runner availability | Partial | `pytest` was not installed in the Python 3.12 environment, so verification used `compileall` plus direct function assertions. |
| Model unload after validation | Pass | The model was explicitly unloaded and the Ollama process list was empty afterward. |
| Disposable sample cleanup | Pass | The generated sample repository was restored to clean after evidence capture. |

### Decision

- Validation level: realistic-scoped-edit-validated
- Approved-write position: still blocked for real projects pending realistic disposable application or explicitly approved non-generated repository validation
- Failure signals: initial trailing-whitespace issue corrected by Aider using diff edit format; pytest unavailable in local Python environment
- Follow-up: Add or select a richer disposable application target before promoting Aider beyond generated-sample scoped-edit validation.

### Sanitization Checklist

- [x] No private endpoints.
- [x] No private IP addresses.
- [x] No local filesystem paths.
- [x] No usernames.
- [x] No private repository names.
- [x] No customer names.
- [x] No tokens or secrets.

## Evidence: 2026-07-13 Disposable Write-Smoke Validation

### Summary

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Surface: Aider CLI
- Aider version: 0.86.2
- Operating system: Windows
- CPU architecture: x64
- Model: qwen3-coder:30b
- Provider: Ollama
- Target repository type: Python API sample
- Target repository source: generated disposable sample
- Tool/write mode: read-only file context plus disposable README write smoke
- Git status before test: clean
- Git status after test: clean
- Private details removed: Yes

### Tests

| Test | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only repository inspection | Pass | Read-only context validation passed before the write-smoke phase. |
| Unexpected file changes during read-only test | Pass | Verified outside Aider with Git; generated sample remained clean after the read phase. |
| Disposable write smoke test | Pass | Aider changed only `README.md` with the expected final line. |
| External changed-file verification | Pass | Harness verified changed-file set, `git diff --check`, and direct README content before restoring the disposable sample. |
| Model unload after validation | Pass | The validation run used unload-after-each behavior and the Ollama process list was empty afterward. |

### Decision

- Validation level: write-smoke-validated
- Approved-write position: blocked pending realistic scoped-edit validation
- Failure signals: none
- Follow-up: Run a realistic scoped-edit validation in a disposable or explicitly approved repository before marking Aider approved-write ready.

### Sanitization Checklist

- [x] No private endpoints.
- [x] No private IP addresses.
- [x] No local filesystem paths.
- [x] No usernames.
- [x] No private repository names.
- [x] No customer names.
- [x] No tokens or secrets.
