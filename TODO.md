- [ ] Complete Milestone 17 full tracked-surface compatibility validation.
- [x] Promote Aider as the first end-to-end non-Continue adapter by completing install, local-model configuration, health, and test automation with sanitized deterministic coverage; keep real-project approved write blocked.

## Future Agent Surface Evidence Expansion

- [x] Retire Roo Code from future validation and configuration work after its upstream project was archived and the extension was shut down; retain historical references only.
- [x] Confirm Kilo Code's documented npm install, local Ollama config, and non-interactive `kilo run --auto` command shape; add a local-only config generator and npm install plan.
- [ ] Resolve Kilo Code's current local-model task-execution failure, then rerun generated-sample read/write validation. The configured remote Ollama provider reaches `qwen3.5:9b`, `qwen3-coder:30b`, and `devstral:24b`, but each current test stopped without inspecting files or using tools.
- [x] Add a local-only OpenCode Ollama config generator and documented npm install plan to the unified setup adapter.
- [x] Validate OpenCode's installed CLI and `opencode run` wrapper against a generated sample with read-only and disposable write-smoke checks.

- [x] Add evidence-gated rule selection guidance for optional Python, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, SQL, and Infrastructure as Code packs.
- [x] Validate optional language rule packs against generated sample repositories with static evidence checks.
- [x] Validate rule packs against Continue CLI repository-discovery, implementation-planning, code-review, and scoped-write workflows on generated medium fixtures. Composite Windows model lanes cover all 28 required cells, and Linux WSL2 evidence independently covers the same matrix.
- [x] Add a machine-readable project-profile classifier with ecosystem, evidence, confidence, and selected rule-pack IDs.
- [x] Activate matching optional language rule packs through project-local installer/config generation so installed projects do not require manual rule wiring.
- [x] Add medium-complexity language samples and a representative validation matrix covering discovery, planning, review, and scoped write; keep editor/model operation cells pending until executed.
- [x] Run the medium-fixture matrix through Continue CLI on Windows and record exact operation-to-model evidence; a Devstral Small 2 default plus Qwen 3.5 35B TypeScript-write override validates all 28 cells.
- [x] Add native Linux/macOS matrix-runner parity with shared Bash orchestration and dry-run validation.
- [x] Run the Linux matrix against live models in WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04. Devstral completed all 28 cells and Qwen completed the TypeScript scoped-write override with one-model-at-a-time unload safeguards.
- [x] Extend language-aware selector lookup to consume Linux validation evidence without inheriting Windows evidence.
- [ ] Complete the native macOS matrix for the remaining language packs. Apple Silicon static validation passed, and Qwen 3.5 9B validates all four Python operations through Continue CLI with external scoped-write verification and model unload; JavaScript/TypeScript code review returned empty output twice on the 16 GB host, so that slice remains unpromoted.
- [x] Generate a read-only language-aware model-lane recommendation from operation-level matrix evidence so a detected project and workflow select only a validated lane. Surface-specific runtime auto-switching remains a future adapter capability.

## Milestone 19: Installer Profiles, Evidence Catalog, And Release Packaging

- [x] Add installer profile options for read-only review and approved-write workflows.
- [x] Add a sanitized evidence catalog for model, surface, OS, language, and write-readiness results.

- [x] Define Capability Evidence Contract v2 keyed by surface, model, provider, OS, surface version, operation, and validation mode.
- [x] Migrate evidence lookup away from first-row-per-model behavior and aggregate duplicate evidence conservatively with provenance.
- [x] Prevent write-readiness evidence from one agent surface from being inherited by another surface.
- [ ] Complete Milestone 19 cross-agent install/configure/test script parity.
- [x] Keep Cline install/configure automation blocked with exact evidence gaps: npm installation is documented and validated, but provider setup requires an isolated CLI data directory plus headless auto-approval for tools; no general write profile is generated.
- [x] Add Aider install/configure automation with an explicit local-only config and supported isolated install methods.
- [ ] Validate Kilo Code install/configure behavior against an installed CLI and generated sample before promoting its scaffolded adapter; do not create new Roo Code automation.
- [ ] Keep OpenHands install/configure/test automation blocked until platform workspace, sandbox, and credential boundaries are defined.

- [x] Consolidate PowerShell agent CLI wrapper defaults behind the shared agent CLI harness default catalog.
- [x] Consolidate Bash agent CLI wrapper defaults behind the shared agent CLI harness default catalog.
- [x] Add lane-specific model scoring that keeps WRITE SAFE reliability-first and can select larger validated PLAN ONLY or DEEP REVIEW models when hardware permits.
- [x] Replace parameter-name-only VRAM estimates for curated models with metadata for quantization assumptions, context target, backend overhead, model architecture or MoE behavior, and configurable memory reserve; retain a labeled low-confidence fallback for unknown tags.
- [x] Consolidate the onboarding/navigation script family behind a shared PowerShell module and native wrapper dispatcher before adding more plugin-specific wrappers.
- [x] Replace the no-PowerShell informational fallback for beginner plan, agent menu, and workflow chooser with a native Linux/macOS Python 3 renderer.
- [x] Define a versioned workflow request, progress, result, warning, and error envelope for dispatchers and the future UI.
- [x] Add a guided command/menu layer so end users choose from a small set of intents instead of individual scripts.
- [x] Keep individual script documentation as appendix/reference material for advanced users and maintainers.
- [x] Define a machine-readable workflow registry for tasks, inputs, outputs, safety level, platform support, and script entry points.
- [x] Define the stable script/API boundary that a future unified starter-toolkit web UI should call by adding a shared command dispatcher over the workflow registry.
- [x] Add cross-platform workflow dispatcher wrappers for Linux and macOS over the shared workflow registry.
- [x] Design a unified web UI for local-AI coding setup, hardware profiling, model choice, config generation, agent-surface testing, and validation.

- [x] Keep the UI evidence-first by showing tested, passed, failed, and recommended-only states before applying changes.
- [x] Generate a local evidence dashboard from committed evidence and surface readiness data.
- [x] Add beginner setup mode for the common local-AI coding setup path.
- [x] Add a health check workflow for Ollama, models, config, duplicate rules, repository detection, and validation status.
- [x] Add a safe cleanup workflow with dry-run support for failed models, stale runtime output, generated samples, and old backups.
- [x] Add a release readiness gate for validation, tests, docs/wiki freshness, whitespace checks, and optional remote workflow status.
- [x] Enforce exact-SHA hosted CI verification after every push, including required Windows/Linux/macOS jobs, failed-log retrieval, and explicit push/CI states.
- [x] Add a model scorecard for tool support, speed, quality, write behavior, context size, hardware tier, and recommended use.
- [ ] Generate surface-specific plugin profiles only after compatibility evidence exists.
- [x] Add sample scenario packs for legacy migration, config refactoring, bug fixing, security review, test generation, and documentation cleanup.

- [ ] Provide or approve suitable non-generated repositories for future real-repository validation.
- [ ] Confirm Kilo Code's safe non-interactive command and local-model selection syntax, then run generated-sample validation with explicit overrides; evaluate a maintained Roo Code successor before adding another editor-agent adapter.
