# Project

## Name

Haven 42

Tagline: Your private, local AI station.

## Purpose

This repository defines an evidence-gated, local-first AI workbench for individual users, developers, teams, consultants, and enterprise groups. It combines repeatable software-engineering workflows with repository-optional chat, writing, summarization, and image capabilities under common routing, approval, privacy, and typed-artifact contracts.

The engineering pack turns common senior engineering activities into version-controlled prompts, rules, agents, and templates that can be reviewed, improved, and reused across repositories. The broader Haven 42 product now includes a runnable loopback-only local web experience over the same tested contracts; Tauri remains an optional later packaging path.

Continue, Aider, and OpenCode are the maintained engineering surfaces. General text capabilities share a provider-neutral adapter: Ollama is live-validated, and llama.cpp's OpenAI-compatible path is live-validated for its exact Linux NVIDIA/CUDA profile. Windows AMD/HIP retains engine-only evidence, and every other profile fails closed. Linux image generation has a live-validated ComfyUI/SDXL provider, and all additional providers or surfaces remain pass-before-ship.

## Current Stage

Milestones 1 through 21 are complete for their defined scopes. Milestone 22A now has
a runnable Python standard-library local web application with loopback-only serving, sanitized system
status, automatically classified local/LAN Ollama connection, installed-model discovery, per-capability model choice, bounded chat, writing, summarization, strict typed progress/warning/result/error envelopes, memory-only failed-input recovery with no automatic retry, bounded effect-free composition planning, verified idle/lifecycle model cleanup, and security-hardened unsigned PyInstaller one-folder development packaging for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Packaging now has hash-locked build inputs, strict evidence allowlists, hostile native integrity tests, whole-archive inventories, and unsigned provenance. Milestone 22B retains executable capability composition, optional Tauri packaging, activated updates, signed distribution, and remaining native platform gates. Milestone 23 owns native
local image profiles and now has consumer-local discovery and consent contracts.
Milestones 24 and 25 retain documentation-only audio/video candidate inventories and
shared media-consent policy. Milestone 26 now has quantization plan/artifact contracts,
OS-aware sanitized profiling, explicit support boundaries, and a no-effect dry-run
selector; live model recipes and activation remain unpromoted. Broader surface and provider parity remains
evidence-gated.

Capability Evidence Contract v2 now prevents model readiness from being
inherited across surfaces, operating systems, or operations. Deterministic
project classification and project-local language-rule activation are
implemented. Lane-specific model scoring now keeps WRITE SAFE
reliability-first while allowing larger validated PLAN ONLY and DEEP REVIEW
models when hardware permits. Model-backed language promotion, richer
runtime-measured model metadata, additional script-family consolidation, and
the desktop UI implementation remain planned work. The onboarding/navigation family now
shares catalog, command-rendering, output, and native-dispatch plumbing while
preserving stable public commands. A schema-v1 workflow envelope now gives
dispatchers and future UI callers a stable, privacy-conscious JSON boundary.

## Target Users

- Individual developers improving personal or client repositories
- Small teams that want consistent review and planning without heavyweight process
- Senior engineers working in enterprise .NET repositories
- Architects reviewing service boundaries and dependency direction
- Security engineers reviewing API and application risks
- Performance engineers investigating reliability and throughput concerns
- Product and delivery leads who need structured implementation plans
- Teams using Continue or another validated local-first agent surface with local or self-hosted model infrastructure

## Goals

- Provide a usable local-first AI workbench for practical engineering and general-purpose workflows.
- Favor local-first operation through Continue, Ollama, and future validated local agent surfaces.
- Make AI-assisted reviews repeatable and auditable.
- Encode practical .NET, ASP.NET Core, Clean Architecture, API, security, testing, logging, performance, and Git guidance.
- Keep role-specific behavior explicit through agents.
- Keep task-specific behavior explicit through prompts.
- Keep reusable standards explicit through rules.
- Provide templates for durable engineering artifacts.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing human engineering review or approval.
- Providing a complete application framework.
- Supporting every language ecosystem equally in the initial release.
- Depending on cloud-hosted LLMs as the default path.
- Encoding organization-specific secrets, policies, or private infrastructure details.

## Product Principles

- Local-first by default.
- Beginner-friendly defaults with enterprise-safe language and workflows where needed.
- Clear separation between agents, prompts, rules, and templates.
- Practical guidance over abstract theory.
- Explicit limitations instead of inflated capability claims.
- Human review remains mandatory for AI-generated recommendations.

## Success Criteria

Milestone 1 is successful when:

- `.continue/config.yaml` can be loaded by Continue.
- Core prompts are available for repository discovery, implementation planning, code review, bug investigation, security review, architecture review, performance review, and documentation.
- Core rules guide .NET, ASP.NET Core, APIs, Clean Architecture, testing, logging, security, performance, SonarQube, and Git work.
- Agents are defined for senior engineering, architecture, security, review, performance, documentation, and product management.
- Templates exist for architecture notes, security reviews, performance reviews, and AI project guidance.
- README usage instructions match validated behavior.
