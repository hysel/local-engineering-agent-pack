# Haven 42

**Your private, local AI station.**

Haven 42 is an evidence-gated, local-first AI workbench for software engineering and general-purpose tasks on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

The project began as a reusable pack for coding agents. It now provides a provider-neutral core for discovering capabilities, selecting safe workflows, running supported local agent surfaces, and producing typed artifacts without making a cloud service the default. The planned product experience is a Tauri desktop application with a bundled local web UI that asks what the user wants to accomplish and routes the request through these tested contracts.

Haven 42 was previously named Local Engineering Agent Pack. Because the project had no external users at the time of the rebrand, product-specific paths, workflow IDs, scripts, and release artifacts adopt the new identity without a legacy compatibility layer; see [`BRANDING.md`](BRANDING.md).

## What Works Today

| Area | Current position |
| --- | --- |
| Engineering agents | Continue, Aider, and OpenCode are the maintained surfaces, with OS-aware setup and validation paths. |
| Engineering workflows | Repository discovery, planning, review, scoped changes, language-aware guidance, workflow dispatch, and evidence reporting are implemented. |
| General local text | `general.chat`, `content.write`, and `content.summarize` use one provider-neutral, session-bound adapter. Ollama is live-validated, including an exact Linux Laguna XS 2.1 conformance cell. llama.cpp is live-validated on its exact Linux NVIDIA/CUDA profile and remains engine-evidence-only on Windows AMD/HIP; every selection fails closed outside admitted profiles. |
| Local images | `media.image.create` has a live-validated Linux ComfyUI/SDXL provider and typed PNG artifacts. A native Windows AMD/RX 7800 XT cell now passes repeated generation, active cancellation, forced recovery, retention cleanup, and uninstall, but remains partial because no newer immutable AMD release exists for the update/rollback gate and consumer onboarding/installer behavior is not yet admitted. Windows NVIDIA, Intel GPU/XPU, and Apple Silicon remain candidates. |
| Product UI | Milestone 22 now has an agreed first-run experience, navigation contract, wireframes, a registry-backed nonvisual view model, and a product-wide progressive onboarding contract with guided, existing-setup, not-now, and structured advanced paths. The 46 engine-side IPC and 55 native-authority policy cases remain preparatory; execution stays disabled and dependency blockers still prevent a desktop runtime from shipping. |
| Music and video | The documentation-only candidate inventories remain the shipping boundary. ACE-Step has a partial exact-profile Linux CUDA instrumental pass; video remains documentation-only. No provider scripts, adapters, harnesses, workflows, or configuration ship before full promotion gates pass. |
| Model quantization | Versioned contracts, sanitized profiling, and trusted-artifact selection are implemented; exact Linux NVIDIA and Windows AMD Ollama comparisons passed, while every other hardware/runtime cell remains evidence-gated. |
| Inference engines | Provider, engine, backend, and model layers are separated. llama.cpp CUDA passed on Linux NVIDIA and HIP passed on Windows AMD; Vulkan failed the patch gate, Intel work is parked pending hardware, IPEX-LLM is retired, and LM Studio is optional API-only software. |

## Product Direction

```text
Tauri desktop shell with bundled local web UI (planned)
        |
Private typed sidecar IPC
        |
Capability registry and deterministic routing
        |
Workflow dispatcher and approval policy
        |
Local providers and supported agent surfaces
        |
Typed artifacts, validation evidence, and recovery
```

The design keeps provider selection, evidence state, permissions, privacy disclosures, and write approval outside model prompts. Optional LLM routing may suggest an intent, but deterministic policy decides what can actually run.

## Evidence Before Features

Every integration follows a pass-before-ship rule. Exact software versions are evaluated on their claimed operating system, hardware, provider, and operation. Failed or incomplete candidates may be documented, but they do not leave scripts, adapters, harnesses, templates, configuration, workflows, or active catalog entries in the shipped solution.

Evidence states distinguish `tested-passed`, `tested-partial`, `failed`, `recommended-only`, and `blocked` capabilities. A fixture contract proves portable behavior; it does not claim that untested native hardware or software works.

## Roadmap At A Glance

| Milestone | Status | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Milestone 20: Hardware-Aware Model And Config Automation | Complete | Stable workflow, recommendation, dispatch, onboarding, and release foundation. |
| Milestone 21: General-Purpose AI Assistant And Intent Routing | Complete | Repository-optional sessions, provider-neutral local text, local images, capability discovery, routing, and typed artifacts. |
| Milestone 22: Unified Product UI And Task Composition | In progress | First product slice and 101 fail-closed engine/native-boundary policy cases defined; actual native bridge, dependency, packaging, signing, and cross-platform gates remain. |
| Milestone 23: Native Local Image Generation | In progress | Linux ComfyUI/SDXL is validated; Windows AMD has a partial native pass, while remaining consumer-local gates stay open. |
| Milestone 24: Local Music And Audio Generation | Live feasibility in progress | ACE-Step has a partial Linux CUDA instrumental pass; no audio provider is promoted. |
| Milestone 25: Local Video Generation | Research in progress | HunyuanVideo, Wan2.2, and LTX-2.3 are recorded without executable integration. |
| Milestone 26: Hardware-Adaptive Model Quantization | Engine evidence expanded | Ollama comparisons passed on Linux NVIDIA and Windows AMD; llama.cpp CUDA passed on Linux NVIDIA and HIP passed on Windows AMD. Vulkan failed its patch gate, Intel is parked, and physical Mac remains last. |

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for milestone scope and [`docs/solution-architecture-review.md`](docs/solution-architecture-review.md) for the completeness standard.

## Purpose

The goal is to make useful local AI capabilities approachable without weakening engineering-grade safety. New users should eventually be able to describe a task in a single local interface; experienced users and automation can continue using the same versioned scripts, registries, and envelopes directly.

For software work, the pack supplies repeatable discovery, implementation planning, code review, security review, architecture review, performance review, documentation, and product-management workflows. For general tasks, it supplies repository-optional sessions and explicit local capability boundaries for chat, writing, summarization, and image creation.

## Quick Start

**Using VS Code or VSCodium for the first time?** Start with
`docs/vscode-continue-setup.md`. It uses the installer to generate the global
Continue config, includes native Windows and macOS commands, avoids
duplicate-rule warnings, and ends with safe read and write checks.

Use this path if you are new to Continue, Ollama, or command-line tools. The steps work on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### 1. Install the basics

Install:

- Ollama: runs the local AI models.
- Node.js: lets you run the Continue CLI with `npx`.
- Continue for your editor: the extension you will use inside VS Code, VSCodium, or another supported editor.

Then open a terminal and check the tools:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
ollama --version
node --version
npx --version
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
ollama --version
node --version
npx --version
```

### 2. Download example local models

The model names below are examples, not permanent requirements. Local model availability changes over time, and the best model depends on your RAM, VRAM, installed Ollama models, and whether you need Agent tools.

The committed config starts with a smaller sample model. If your machine can run a larger model, the hardware profile and install scripts can create a local-only config that selects a stronger installed model automatically.

The starter config also uses responsive defaults for local machines: `contextLength: 16384` and `maxTokens: 2048`. Increase those values only after the model feels reliable and you need deeper context for larger repositories.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Optional stronger models for high-resource machines after validation:

```bash
ollama pull devstral-small-2:24b
ollama pull qwen3-coder:30b
```

The model helper scripts use `config/model-recommendations.tsv` as the curated model priority list. You usually do not need to edit it during setup. Update it only after validating a better local model for your hardware and workflow.

Optional online model discovery is candidate research only. It should not
change the offline default setup, pull models automatically, or mark a model as
tool-safe without local validation. See `docs/online-model-discovery.md`.

Discovery can query independent Ollama and Hugging Face source adapters using
arbitrary search terms rather than a fixed family allowlist. Every result stays
candidate-only until its exact artifact, license, hardware, runtime, surface,
and operation pass local validation.

To pull and preflight Agent model candidates through the Ollama API before
manual Continue Apply testing, use `docs/local-agent-model-testing.md`.

## Model Selection

If you are unsure which model fits your machine, run the hardware profile script. If your LLM runs on another machine, use `docs/remote-hardware-profile.md` to collect that machine's profile over SSH:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\get-local-model-profile.windows.ps1
```

Linux:

```bash
./scripts/get-local-model-profile.linux.sh
```

macOS:

```bash
./scripts/get-local-model-profile.macos.sh
```

Then use `docs/local-model-selection.md` to choose the final model. For an offline recommendation JSON that uses your hardware profile, curated model and model-fit catalogs, context target, memory reserve, and validation evidence, run `scripts/recommend-local-agent-config.*`; to write the result to local-only Continue config, run `scripts/apply-recommended-agent-config.*`. See `docs/hardware-aware-recommendations.md`. Treat every recommendation as a starting point, not proof that the model is safe for approved edits. Use `docs/model-tool-use-validation.md` before trusting a model for Agent tools or approved write mode.

To install this pack and create a local-only config using the recommended installed model, use `--auto-model-config` with the install script.

### 3. Copy this pack into your project

Copy the `.continue` folder from this repository into the project you want to review.

Your project should then look like this:

```text
your-project/
  .continue/
    config.yaml
    prompts/
    rules/
    agents/
    templates/
```

If your project already has a `.continue` folder, back it up first or compare the files before replacing anything.

### 4. Start Ollama

Make sure Ollama is running. To check it, run:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
ollama list
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
ollama list
```

If the command shows your models, you are ready.

### 5. Open your project in Continue

Open the project you want to review, not this pack repository.

Continue should use the config file that now lives inside that project:

```text
.continue/config.yaml
```

Use the project-local copy of `.continue/config.yaml`. Do not point Continue at the original pack folder after you copy the pack into your project.

Quick checks:

- The editor file explorer shows your project files.
- Your project has `.continue/config.yaml`.
- Continue shows the local Ollama model from that config.
- Continue can see the prompts such as `repository-discovery` and `implementation-plan`.

If Continue does not show a model or prompts, make the copied `.continue/config.yaml` your active Continue config. Some editor setups use a global/default Continue config; in that case, use the installer or hardware-aware apply script with `-GlobalConfig` or `--global-config` so the global file is generated with absolute prompt, rule, and doc references.

Do not copy `.continue/config.local.yaml` into the global Continue config by hand. Local config files can contain `file://./...` references that only make sense inside the project `.continue` folder. When copied globally, they can make Continue look for prompts under the editor install folder.

If you see duplicate rule warnings, you probably loaded the same rules from both the global Continue config and the project-local `.continue` folder. Regenerate the global config without the include-rules option; generated global configs omit rules by default.

For VS Code, VSCodium, Agent mode, duplicate-rule, and CLI fallback checks, use `docs/editor-compatibility.md`.

### 6. Run a read-only prompt first

Start with one of these:

- `repository-discovery`
- `implementation-plan`
- `code-review`
- `documentation`
- `release-readiness`

Good first request:

```text
Run repository discovery for this project.
Do not modify files.

Identify:
1. The project type
2. The major files and folders
3. The current architecture
4. The main risks
5. The suggested next steps
```

## Using The Pack Day To Day

Use this flow after the pack is installed and Continue can see the model.

1. Start with read-only discovery or planning.
2. Review the response and check whether the assistant used real project evidence.
3. Ask for an implementation plan before approving changes.
4. Approve one small change at a time.
5. Run the smallest useful validation after each change.
6. Use `git status` to confirm exactly what changed.

Good day-to-day prompts:

```text
Create an implementation plan for this change.
Do not modify files yet.
List affected files, risks, tests, rollback, and definition of done.
```

```text
Review the current changes.
Focus on bugs, regressions, missing tests, security risks, and maintainability.
Do not modify files.
```

```text
Use approved write mode for this task only.
Edit only the files needed for the approved plan.
After editing, explain the diff and tell me what validation you ran.
```

In approved write mode, Continue should use edit/apply tools. If the assistant says it cannot directly edit files, only explains what it would do, or asks you to create files manually, write tools are not validated yet. Use the smoke test in `docs/tool-use-modes.md`.

For real code changes, also confirm the assistant can read file contents, not
just list files. If it cannot read the files it wants to change, stop and fix
tool access before approving implementation.

After any approved write, verify the diff yourself. If the assistant says it
changed a file but `git diff -- <file>` is empty, the write did not apply.

Before approving write mode, read:

- `docs/tool-use-modes.md`
- `docs/scoped-edits.md`
- `docs/approved-tool-backed-changes.md`
- `docs/model-tool-use-validation.md`

## Quick Validation

Run the validation script from this repository after copying or editing the pack.

To catch pack validation problems before they reach GitHub Actions, enable the
tracked pre-push hook once per clone:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-git-hooks.ps1
```

The hook requires a Full pack test before `git push`, including the executable-bit
check for Linux and macOS shell scripts. If the exact clean commit and tree just
passed Full, a private `.git` receipt prevents an identical local rerun. GitHub
still runs Full independently.

After pushing, verify the exact commit on GitHub rather than assuming the push
is complete because local tests passed:

```powershell
$sha = git rev-parse HEAD
.\scripts\verify-hosted-ci.ps1 -CommitSha $sha
```

Linux and macOS use `verify-hosted-ci.linux.sh` and
`verify-hosted-ci.macos.sh`. A push is complete only when the script reports
`CI passed`. See `docs/hosted-ci-verification.md`.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\test-pack.ps1 -Tier Fast
.\scripts\test-pack.ps1 -Tier Full
```

Linux:

```bash
./scripts/test-pack.linux.sh --tier fast
./scripts/test-pack.linux.sh --tier full
```

macOS:

```bash
./scripts/test-pack.macos.sh --tier fast
./scripts/test-pack.macos.sh --tier full
```

Full includes static validation. Use the Integration tier when working on
installers, generated artifacts, routing, or packaging. Each test reports its
duration; see `docs/test-tiers.md`. The Linux and macOS test scripts are native
Bash scripts and do not require PowerShell.

## Install Or Update A Target Repository

Use the installer to copy this pack into the repository you want to review.

Windows PowerShell uses the parameter name `-TargetRepo`. Do not use
`-TargetRepository`; that is not a valid installer parameter.

Preview what would be copied:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-continue-pack.ps1 -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project" -DryRun
```

Linux:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.linux.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --dry-run
```

macOS:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.macos.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --dry-run
```

Install or update the target repository:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-continue-pack.ps1 -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project"
```

Choose an install profile when you know how the pack will be used:

```powershell
# Review and planning only; no edit/apply roles.
.\scripts\install-continue-pack.ps1 -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project" -InstallProfile read-only

# Approved-write workflow; creates scoped WRITE SAFE, PLAN ONLY, and DEEP REVIEW lanes.
.\scripts\install-continue-pack.ps1 -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project" -InstallProfile approved-write
```

Create a local-only config with automatic model selection:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-continue-pack.ps1 -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project" -AutoModelConfig
```

Create a local-only config with safer model lanes directly when you prefer the older explicit flag:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-continue-pack.ps1 -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project" -ModelLanes
```

After a model passes local validation, install it into one local-only profile
without changing committed shared config:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-validated-model.ps1 `
  -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project" `
  -Model "devstral-small-2:24b" `
  -Profile plan-only
```

If your editor uses the global Continue config instead of the project-local
`.continue/config.yaml`, install the pack and update the global config with
absolute references to the target repository's installed prompts and docs:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-continue-pack.ps1 -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project" -GlobalConfig
```

Generated global config omits `rules:` by default. This avoids duplicate rule
warnings when the opened project also has `.continue/rules`. Use the default
unless you are intentionally running from global config only.

For a local-network Ollama server, keep the endpoint out of committed project
files and pass it only when generating the global config:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-continue-pack.ps1 `
  -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project" `
  -GlobalConfig `
  -GlobalConfigApiBase "http://127.0.0.1:11434"
```

For a global config that uses model lanes and a local-network Ollama server:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-continue-pack.ps1 `
  -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project" `
  -ModelLanes `
  -GlobalConfig `
  -GlobalConfigApiBase "http://127.0.0.1:11434"
```

Only include rules in the global config when the editor will not also load the
project-local `.continue` folder:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-continue-pack.ps1 -TargetRepo "C:\path\to\your-project" -GlobalConfig -GlobalConfigIncludeRules
```

Linux:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.linux.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project
```

Choose an install profile when you know how the pack will be used:

```bash
# Review and planning only; no edit/apply roles.
./scripts/install-continue-pack.linux.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --install-profile read-only

# Approved-write workflow; creates scoped WRITE SAFE, PLAN ONLY, and DEEP REVIEW lanes.
./scripts/install-continue-pack.linux.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --install-profile approved-write
```

Create a local-only config with automatic model selection:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.linux.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --auto-model-config
```

Create a local-only config with safer model lanes:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.linux.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --model-lanes
```

After a model passes local validation, install it into one local-only profile
without changing committed shared config:

```bash
./scripts/install-validated-model.linux.sh \
  --target-repo /path/to/your-project \
  --model devstral-small-2:24b \
  --profile plan-only
```

Update the global Continue config when the editor does not load the project-local
config:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.linux.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --global-config
```

Use shared assets for multiple repositories:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.linux.sh   --target-repo /path/to/your-project   --shared-assets   --global-config-api-base http://127.0.0.1:11434
```

macOS:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.macos.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project
```

Choose an install profile when you know how the pack will be used:

```bash
# Review and planning only; no edit/apply roles.
./scripts/install-continue-pack.macos.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --install-profile read-only

# Approved-write workflow; creates scoped WRITE SAFE, PLAN ONLY, and DEEP REVIEW lanes.
./scripts/install-continue-pack.macos.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --install-profile approved-write
```

Create a local-only config with automatic model selection:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.macos.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --auto-model-config
```

Create a local-only config with safer model lanes:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.macos.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --model-lanes
```

After a model passes local validation, install it into one local-only profile
without changing committed shared config:

```bash
./scripts/install-validated-model.macos.sh \
  --target-repo /path/to/your-project \
  --model devstral-small-2:24b \
  --profile plan-only
```

Update the global Continue config when the editor does not load the project-local
config:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.macos.sh --target-repo /path/to/your-project --global-config
```

For Apple Silicon MLX instead of Ollama, start a loopback-only MLX server and
use the dedicated MLX config mode. It generates an OpenAI-compatible model
configuration rather than placing an MLX model name in an Ollama config:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.macos.sh \
  --target-repo /path/to/your-project \
  --global-config \
  --mlx-config \
  --mlx-api-base http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
```

See `docs/macos-agent-host-bootstrap.md` for the loopback-only MLX server and
VSCodium validation steps.

Use shared assets for multiple repositories:

```bash
./scripts/install-continue-pack.macos.sh   --target-repo /path/to/your-project   --shared-assets   --global-config-api-base http://127.0.0.1:11434
```

The installer:

- Copies the pack's `.continue` files into the target repository.
- Excludes local config overrides such as `.continue/config.local.yaml`.
- Backs up an existing target `.continue` folder before replacing it.
- Validates that copied config file references resolve.
- Can create `.continue/config.local.yaml` with the model recommended by the hardware profile helper.
- Supports install profiles: `default`, `read-only`, and `approved-write`.
- Can create `.continue/config.local.yaml` with a read-only review profile that omits edit/apply roles.
- Can create `.continue/config.local.yaml` with three Agent model profiles: WRITE SAFE, PLAN ONLY, and DEEP REVIEW. By default, all three use the simple-hardware starter model, plus the separate embedding model.
- Can install a selected validated model into one local-only profile without changing committed shared config.
- Can update the global Continue config, with a backup, when an editor does not load project-local config files.
- Can install reusable shared assets into one local folder and point the global Continue config at that folder for multi-repository workflows.
- Omits rules from generated global config by default to avoid duplicate rule warnings.
- Writes Windows global config file references as `file://C:/path/...` for VSCodium compatibility.
- Refuses to install into this pack repository itself.

Linux and macOS installer wrappers are native Bash scripts and do not require PowerShell.

## Common Problems

Use the detailed guides in `docs/`, starting with `docs/troubleshooting.md`.

| Problem | What to try first |
| --- | --- |
| Continue does not show a model | Confirm Continue is using `.continue/config.yaml`, then run `ollama list`. |
| Ollama connection error | Start Ollama and confirm `ollama list` works in a terminal. |
| The starter model is too slow or will not load | Run the hardware profile script and follow `docs/local-model-selection.md`. |
| `cn` is not recognized | Use `npx @continuedev/cli --config .continue/config.yaml` or install the Continue CLI globally. |
| The assistant prints raw JSON tool calls | Use a stronger tool-capable model or the runtime-context fallback in `docs/troubleshooting.md`. |
| The assistant creates a file in the wrong folder | Stop, check `git status --short --untracked-files=all`, remove only the wrong test artifact, and use the `PATH_AMBIGUOUS` guidance in `docs/troubleshooting.md`. |
| The Apply panel targets the wrong file | Do not click Apply; treat it as `APPLY_TARGET_MISMATCH` and use `docs/troubleshooting.md`. |
| The assistant prints `edit_file` but nothing changes | Treat it as `WRITE_NOT_APPLIED`; tool-call text is not proof that the file changed. |
| The assistant says it created and read back a file, but PowerShell or shell cannot find it | Treat it as `WRITE_NOT_APPLIED`; approved-write readiness requires external `git status` plus file existence/content checks. |
| Two approval prompts duplicate the same line | For existing-file validation, temporarily set `create_new_file` to Excluded, pre-create `continue-agent-write-test.md`, and approve only one edit diff. |
| The assistant says no file is open and asks for a path | Keep the repository folder open in the editor and use the `WORKSPACE_UNAVAILABLE` guidance in `docs/troubleshooting.md`. |
| Linux or macOS validation script is not executable | Run `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`, then rerun the wrapper script. |
| Duplicate rules appear in Continue | Regenerate the global config without `-GlobalConfigIncludeRules`; the default global config omits rules to avoid duplicates with project-local `.continue/rules`. |

## Beginner Safety Rules

- Start with review and planning prompts before asking for changes.
- Do not commit private IP addresses, tokens, local paths, or raw company code into this pack.
- Keep machine-specific settings in local files, not in `.continue/config.yaml`.
- Use `docs/local-config-safety.md` before adding local endpoints, model experiments, or hardware details.
- Treat AI output as a draft. Review it before changing code.
- Use `git status` before and after AI-assisted work so you know what changed.
- Use `docs/tool-use-modes.md` before asking the assistant to modify a reviewed project.
- Use `docs/scoped-edits.md` to turn an approved plan into one small, reviewable change at a time.
- When you name a file without a folder, the assistant should assume the currently opened repository folder first. If it creates a duplicate such as `src/README.md` instead of editing the existing `README.md`, treat that as a failed write test.
- If no file is open, the assistant should still try to discover the opened workspace with tools before asking you for a path.
- Before clicking Apply, confirm the Apply target is the same file the assistant read and said it would change.
- For existing-file write tests, exclude `create_new_file` and pre-create the target file so the assistant must use one edit path. Two approvals for the same target can duplicate content.
- Treat any validation answer that combines a failure signal with a successful status label as failed or limited; for example, `READ_TOOLS_UNAVAILABLE` cannot be `read-only tool validated`.

## Do Not Commit These

Keep these out of committed files:

- `.continue/config.local.yaml`
- Private IP addresses, internal hostnames, or local-network endpoints
- API keys, GitHub tokens, SonarQube tokens, or other secrets
- Usernames, home-directory paths, or machine-specific paths
- Raw runtime validation output
- Private repository names or customer names
- Hardware profiles that include sensitive machine details

Use `docs/local-config-safety.md` before adding local endpoints, model experiments, hardware details, or tool configuration.

### `.continue/config.yaml`

The Continue entry point. It defines local Ollama models, repository context providers, local rule files, local prompt files, and an empty MCP server list for future integrations.

### `.continue/agents`

Role-specific assistant definitions with a shared operating contract for permissions, tool use, untrusted repository content, failure reporting, and post-edit verification.

### `.continue/prompts`

Task-oriented, read-only review and planning workflows with explicit evidence, tool-use, filename-fidelity, and failure-reporting contracts.

### `.continue/rules`

Reusable engineering standards with evidence gates and file globs that keep ecosystem-specific guidance scoped to matching repositories.

### `.continue/templates`

Output templates for durable engineering artifacts with explicit evidence scope, confidence or finding status, validation, and open questions.

### `examples`

Representative outputs for major workflows. These examples show expected structure, tone, and level of detail for repository discovery, implementation planning, code review, architecture review, security review, performance review, and release readiness.

### `docs`

Workflow documentation for enterprise review practices, including MCP research, setup guidance, workflow examples, SonarQube integration options, compatibility notes, the manual SonarQube review workflow, validation checklists, and troubleshooting guidance.

Use this folder for deeper instructions after the quick start. Important guides include local model selection, local Agent model testing, model tool-use validation, local model reliability, shared asset installation planning, tool-use modes, scoped edits, validation, runtime validation, MCP setup, MCP examples, and troubleshooting.

### `scripts`

Repository validation automation for release checks and portable configuration invariants.

## Current Status

The repository contains a mature workflow foundation and an early general-purpose capability layer:

- `.continue/config.yaml` targets Continue `schema: v1`.
- Local-first Ollama model defaults are defined.
- Continue, Aider, and OpenCode are maintained; failed or retired surfaces are not shipped as partial integrations.
- Core engineering rules, prompts, agents, templates, workflow registries, and dispatch envelopes are implemented.
- Configured local rule and prompt file references have been statically checked.
- Repository-optional chat, writing, summarization, and Linux image generation have live-validated local adapters.
- Windows, Linux, and macOS contracts are covered in hosted CI; native provider claims remain specific to recorded evidence.
- MCP and SonarQube support are documented as optional integration paths, not default wired integrations.

Version `0.3.0` established evidence-gated cross-agent validation, hardware-aware model lanes, Apple Silicon MLX support, OS-aware command execution, model-residency controls, exact-SHA hosted CI verification, workflow registries and dispatch envelopes, guided onboarding, release automation, and the general-purpose AI capability foundation. Later work remains under `Unreleased` until the next deliberate release.

## Standard Usage

The standard workflow is:

1. Install or copy this pack into a repository that uses Continue.
2. Ensure Ollama is running with the configured models available.
3. Point Continue at `.continue/config.yaml`.
4. Use the included prompts for discovery, planning, review, security, architecture, performance, and documentation workflows.
5. Keep project-specific decisions in the top-level documentation files.

Starter local model assumptions:

- Chat/edit/apply/tool workflows: `qwen3.5:9b` as the current WRITE SAFE starter candidate
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text`
- Ollama endpoint: default local Ollama endpoint

For larger machines, higher-risk workflows, or Agent tool use, run the hardware profile helper and use `docs/local-model-selection.md` before changing models.

For Agent tools or approved write mode, also run the local model preflight in
`docs/local-agent-model-testing.md` and the read-only checklist in
`docs/model-tool-use-validation.md`. A hardware recommendation is only a
candidate until tool execution is validated in the editor or CLI surface you
plan to use.

For mixed-model workflows, use model profiles instead of giving every model
`edit` and `apply` roles. The simple-hardware default points all three Agent
profiles at `qwen3.5:9b`; only the `1 - WRITE SAFE` lane should have `chat`,
`edit`, and `apply`. Planning and review lanes should stay `chat` only, even if
you later upgrade them to heavier models.

For private endpoints, local model experiments, or machine-specific settings, use `docs/local-config-safety.md` before editing committed config files.

To collect a sanitized hardware profile for local model selection:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\get-local-model-profile.windows.ps1
```

Linux:

```bash
./scripts/get-local-model-profile.linux.sh
```

macOS:

```bash
./scripts/get-local-model-profile.macos.sh
```

For detailed setup, script usage, model selection, troubleshooting, validation, evidence catalog, and tool-use safety instructions, start in the `docs/` folder.

Example Ollama setup:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3.5:9b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Optional Continue CLI usage with `npx`:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
npx @continuedev/cli --config .continue/config.yaml
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
npx @continuedev/cli --config .continue/config.yaml
```

If the Continue CLI is installed globally, `cn` may also be available:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cn --config .continue/config.yaml
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
cn --config .continue/config.yaml
```

If PowerShell reports that `cn` is not recognized, use the `npx` command above or install the CLI globally:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
npm install -g @continuedev/cli
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
npm install -g @continuedev/cli
```

Runtime status:

- Continue CLI config loading was validated with `npx @continuedev/cli`.
- Continue initialized the config, model, MCP, system-message, and file-index services.
- Model-backed execution was validated using a local-network Ollama endpoint as a test-time override.
- A prompt-file smoke test completed successfully.
- Representative workflow examples are available in `examples/`.

## Validation

Run the Fast tier during editing:

```powershell
.\scripts\test-pack.ps1 -Tier Fast
```

Run the Full tier before push or release:

```powershell
.\scripts\test-pack.ps1 -Tier Full
```

On Linux:

```bash
./scripts/test-pack.linux.sh --tier fast
./scripts/test-pack.linux.sh --tier full
```

On macOS:

```bash
./scripts/test-pack.macos.sh --tier fast
./scripts/test-pack.macos.sh --tier full
```

The Full tier already includes pack validation. The Linux and macOS scripts are
native Bash scripts and do not require PowerShell. See `docs/test-tiers.md`.

The script checks the configured version, required files, local `.continue` file references, default MCP posture, and obvious committed private endpoints or secrets.

For runtime validation against a target repository, run the command for your operating system.

Windows:

```powershell
$Pack = "C:\path\to\haven-42"
& "$Pack\scripts\run-runtime-validation.ps1" -TargetRepo (Get-Location).Path
```

Linux:

```bash
PACK="/path/to/haven-42"
"$PACK/scripts/run-runtime-validation.linux.sh" --target-repo "$PWD"
```

macOS:

```bash
PACK="/path/to/haven-42"
"$PACK/scripts/run-runtime-validation.macos.sh" --target-repo "$PWD"
```

Raw runtime outputs are written to an ignored local folder and should be reviewed before any sanitized summary is committed.

To generate a context file without relying on Continue tool execution, run the command for your operating system.

Windows:

```powershell
$Pack = "C:\path\to\haven-42"
& "$Pack\scripts\generate-runtime-context.ps1" -TargetRepo (Get-Location).Path -OutputPath .\runtime-context.md
```

Linux:

```bash
PACK="/path/to/haven-42"
"$PACK/scripts/generate-runtime-context.linux.sh" --target-repo "$PWD" --output-path ./runtime-context.md
```

macOS:

```bash
PACK="/path/to/haven-42"
"$PACK/scripts/generate-runtime-context.macos.sh" --target-repo "$PWD" --output-path ./runtime-context.md
```

## Design Principles

- Prefer local-first operation for private enterprise codebases.
- Make prompts repeatable, reviewable, and version-controlled.
- Keep rules explicit enough to guide AI output without hiding engineering judgment.
- Optimize for .NET, ASP.NET Core, Clean Architecture, secure APIs, and maintainable services.
- Treat AI output as engineering assistance that still requires human review.
