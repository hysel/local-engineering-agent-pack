# Architecture

## Overview

Haven 42 is organized as a provider-neutral capability, configuration, documentation, and workflow repository. Its engineering foundation includes the `.continue` directory plus maintained Aider and OpenCode paths; its general-purpose layer adds repository-optional sessions, routing, provider adapters, and typed artifacts.

The currently validated runtime architecture is:

`capability -> provider contract -> inference engine -> hardware backend -> model artifact`

Text capability discovery and invocation currently normalize Ollama and OpenAI-compatible llama.cpp APIs behind one dry-run-first contract. OpenAI-compatible selection requires an exact admitted engine, backend, and hardware profile from `config/inference-engine-registry.json`; unknown, failed, parked, and cross-profile combinations fail closed.

        |                       |
        |                       +-> schema-v1 request/result envelope
        v
tested workflow engines -> sanitized reports, local-only config, validation evidence
```

The long-term architecture should keep prompts, rules, templates, validation scripts, and evidence formats portable enough to evaluate with other local-first coding-agent surfaces.

The accepted Milestone 22 desktop architecture adds a Tauri 2 shell without replacing these contracts:

```text
Bundled React/TypeScript UI
        |
        v
Tauri capability allowlist and native path selection
        |
        v
versioned typed stdin/stdout IPC
        |
        v
packaged Haven 42 engine sidecar
        |
        v
capability registry -> workflow registry -> existing tested engines
```

The desktop path loads no remote UI code, exposes no generic shell bridge, and listens on no TCP port. A hardened loopback mode is a separate headless Linux, SSH, development, and diagnostics boundary and cannot inherit desktop evidence. Windows, Linux, and macOS launchers, webviews, sidecars, packages, signing, updates, and uninstall behavior are promoted independently.

## Repository Layers

### Project Documentation

Top-level markdown files define the product contract, architecture, roadmap, style conventions, implementation tasks, decisions, and release notes.

These files explain why the pack exists and how contributors should evolve it.

### Agent Surface Configuration

`.continue/config.yaml` is the intended entry point for the current Continue integration.

It should eventually define:

- Local model configuration
- Context providers
- Prompt references
- Rule references
- Agent or mode wiring, where supported
- MCP integration points, when implemented

### Agents

`.continue/agents` contains role-specific assistant definitions.

Agents should describe durable professional behavior, responsibilities, boundaries, and expected outputs. They should not duplicate every task instruction from prompts or every standard from rules.

Initial agents:

- `senior-engineer.md`
- `architect.md`
- `security-engineer.md`

Secondary agents:

- `reviewer.md`
- `performance.md`
- `documentation.md`
- `product-manager.md`

### Prompts

`.continue/prompts` contains task-specific workflows.

Prompts should define:

- When to use the workflow
- What context to gather
- How to reason about the task
- Expected output format
- Risk checks and verification steps

Prompts should reference rules by concept, but should avoid copying entire rule files.

### Rules

`.continue/rules` contains reusable engineering standards.

Rules should be concise, enforceable, and broadly applicable. They should define expectations for quality, security, maintainability, testing, logging, API design, and framework usage.

Rules should avoid task-specific instructions that belong in prompts.

### Project Profiles And Optional Rule Activation

`config/project-profile-rules.json` defines deterministic ecosystem signals.
The cross-platform `get-project-profile` scripts inspect relative filenames,
emit a sanitized project profile, and select optional language rule-pack IDs.

During project-local installation, selected sources from
`.continue/rule-packs/` are copied into
`.continue/rules/active-language-<id>.md`. Unmatched source packs remain
inactive. Shared-assets mode skips this project-specific step because one
central asset folder can serve repositories with different ecosystems.

### Templates

`.continue/templates` contains structured output formats for artifacts that may be committed or shared.

Templates should make review outputs consistent and easy to scan.

### Capability Evidence

`config/capability-evidence-contract.json` defines Capability Evidence Contract
v2, and `config/evidence-catalog.tsv` stores sanitized records. Capability
readiness is keyed by surface, surface version, provider, model, operating
system, operation, and validation mode.

Recommendation and reporting consumers aggregate duplicate keys to the most
conservative status while retaining provenance. They do not inherit write
readiness across agent surfaces, operations, or operating systems.

### Workflow Orchestration

`config/workflows.json` provides stable workflow IDs and platform entry points.
`config/workflow-envelope-contract.json` defines schema-v1 requests and
execution responses for the PowerShell and native Linux/macOS dispatchers.

The envelope reports accepted, progress, warning, result, and error events.
Argument values and child output are omitted by default so future UI callers
do not casually persist local paths, endpoints, or repository output. Existing
direct CLI dispatcher behavior remains supported.

The onboarding/navigation family preserves three beginner-facing commands but
shares non-domain mechanics. `scripts/OnboardingGuidance.psm1` owns catalog
loading, workflow lookup, platform command rendering, and report output for
PowerShell. The Linux/macOS wrappers delegate argument routing to
`scripts/onboarding-guidance.shared.sh`. Full native rendering for these
informational views remains a known portability gap; native validation and
installer workflows are unaffected and continue to require no PowerShell.

## Responsibility Boundaries

- `config.yaml` wires the pack together.
- Agents define role behavior.
- Prompts define task flow.
- Rules define standards.
- Templates define durable output shape.
- Capability evidence defines what a specific surface/model/environment operation has actually proven.
- Project profiles define which optional language rules a target repository activates and the filename evidence supporting that decision.
- The language workflow validation matrix maps optional rule packs to medium-complexity fixtures and required operations while keeping unexecuted editor/model evidence explicitly pending.
- Workflow registry and envelope contracts define stable, versioned automation boundaries without owning workflow business logic.
- Top-level docs define project intent and governance.

## Dependency Policy

The pack uses a simple dependency direction:

```text
config.yaml
  -> agents
  -> prompts
  -> rules
  -> templates

top-level docs govern all layers but are not runtime dependencies
```

Allowed references:

- `config.yaml` may reference rules, prompts, docs, context providers, models, and future MCP servers.
- Agents may reference rules and prompts conceptually.
- Prompts may reference rules and templates conceptually.
- Rules should not depend on prompts or agents.
- Templates should not depend on prompts, agents, or rules.
- Top-level docs may describe any layer.

This keeps reusable policy below workflow orchestration and prevents circular instruction dependencies.

## Domain Language

The project domain is local-first engineering workflow guidance.

- Pack: the complete reusable engineering-agent bundle in this repository.
- Agent surface: the editor, CLI, or runtime environment that loads the pack assets and executes model/tool workflows.
- Agent: a role-specific assistant definition.
- Prompt: a task-specific workflow that can be invoked by a user.
- Rule: reusable engineering guidance applied across workflows.
- Template: structured output for a durable artifact or review.
- Finding: a concrete issue identified during review.
- Recommendation: an actionable change or decision proposal.
- Workflow: a repeatable task sequence such as repository discovery, code review, or security review.
- Model lane: a purpose-specific local model role such as WRITE SAFE, PLAN ONLY, or DEEP REVIEW.
- Selection policy: a versioned scoring contract that requires exact capability evidence and ranks eligible models for one model lane.
- Model-fit profile: a versioned, reviewable memory-planning assumption for an exact model tag, including quantization assumption, weights, context-sensitive cache, runtime overhead, architecture, and reserve.
- Quantization plan: a no-effect decision that binds immutable source identity, license, target runtime/format, local hardware inputs, storage, disclosures, and either an exact trusted artifact, a possible local derivative, or no safe recommendation.
- Quantized-artifact manifest: a local lifecycle record for exact input/output hashes, pinned tools, recipe parameters, runtime/hardware evidence, validation, activation, rollback, and cleanup.

## Initial Architecture Decisions

- The pack is local-first and should work with Ollama before cloud model assumptions are introduced.
- Continue remains the first supported agent surface, but the project should avoid coupling reusable guidance to Continue-only behavior when a portable abstraction is practical.
- The first ecosystem focus is .NET and ASP.NET Core, with enterprise-grade guidance kept useful for smaller projects too.
- Clean Architecture guidance should be practical and testable, not ceremonial.
- Security and performance review guidance should be built into early milestones.
- MCP and SonarQube support should be documented as integration targets until implemented.
- Tool-enabled project changes should be treated as an approved execution mode, not the default review posture.
- Local model selection should remain hardware-aware but portable, keeping machine-specific endpoints and hardware details out of committed shared config.
- Model-lane eligibility must require exact surface, version, provider, operating system, operation, and validation-mode evidence; scores may rank eligible models but must not manufacture missing capability evidence.
- WRITE SAFE selection should favor validated reliability and VRAM headroom, while planning and review may favor greater fitting capacity after exact lane evidence is established.
- Curated model-fit profiles should take precedence over name-derived estimates, disclose every assumption, and keep unknown tags labeled as low-confidence rather than implying measured compatibility.
- Trusted compatible pre-quantized artifacts should be preferred over local conversion; equal bit counts never imply format, kernel, runtime, or accelerator compatibility.
- Quantization planning may inspect local hardware but must omit persistent identity fields, perform no network/download/conversion/activation effects, and keep profiles and model artifacts out of commits.
- Future UI callers should use stable workflow IDs and the versioned envelope rather than invoking or parsing individual script families directly.

## Open Questions

- Should the current local file references in `.continue/config.yaml` be adjusted after validation in Continue?
- Which Ollama models should be recommended for larger enterprise repositories?
- Which additional agent surfaces should be validated first after Continue?
- Should agents be further integrated as native Continue agent files if the target Continue version supports richer agent packaging?
- How should SonarQube findings be provided to the assistant: pasted reports, MCP, CLI output, or another integration?
- Which MCP servers are in scope for the first integration milestone?
- Should prompt examples be added as committed fixtures or generated on demand during release validation?
- What tool execution surface should be considered the supported path for approved project changes?
- Which hardware signals are reliable enough to drive dynamic local model selection across Windows, Linux, and macOS?
