# Architecture

## Overview

Haven 42 is organized as a provider-neutral capability, configuration, documentation, and workflow repository. Its engineering foundation includes the `.continue` directory plus maintained Aider and OpenCode paths; its general-purpose layer adds repository-optional sessions, routing, provider adapters, and typed artifacts.

The currently validated runtime architecture is:

`capability -> provider contract -> inference engine -> hardware backend -> model artifact`

Text capability discovery and invocation currently normalize Ollama and OpenAI-compatible llama.cpp APIs behind one dry-run-first contract. The direct llama.cpp path is live-validated only for the exact Linux NVIDIA/CUDA profile. OpenAI-compatible selection requires an exact admitted engine, backend, and hardware profile from `config/inference-engine-registry.json`; unknown, failed, parked, and cross-profile combinations fail closed.

        |                       +-> schema-v1 request/result envelope
        v
tested workflow engines -> sanitized reports, local-only config, validation evidence
```

The long-term architecture should keep prompts, rules, templates, validation scripts, and evidence formats portable enough to evaluate with other local-first coding-agent surfaces.

Milestone 22A adds a runnable local web slice without replacing these contracts:

```text
Bundled HTML/CSS/JavaScript on 127.0.0.1
        |
Host + Origin + session-token enforcement
        |
Python standard-library local server
        |
shared endpoint security -> exact-digest Ollama text + loopback ComfyUI image
        |
workflow registry -> read-only plan artifacts (no process or arguments)
        |
unload and process-list verification after every response
```

The process persists no endpoint, prompt, response, or provider run detail; exposes no repository, generic filesystem, shell, or arbitrary process API; permits no remote UI assets; and cannot bind to a LAN interface. Automatic text selection requires the exact installed Ollama digest and matching capability evidence. Text, workflow-plan, and image execution use the shared schema-v1 event vocabulary. The browser rejects malformed, non-monotonic, multiple-terminal, or post-terminal event streams before rendering an artifact. Unverified manual models add a warning event; provider failures return typed errors and memory-only recovery declarations. No automatic retry occurs, and a retry is always a new request.

The Software view is registry-derived but plan-only: it admits only `uiReady`,
`read-only` records, accepts no renderer arguments, and starts no process. The
Images view is a separate authority boundary for the promoted Linux
ComfyUI/SDXL profile. It requires a loopback endpoint, discovers the exact
checkpoint, submits a fixed built-in workflow, caps and validates the PNG,
clears API history, and returns a browser-memory artifact for a user-triggered
download. Provider-side image retention is disclosed and is not confused with
a Haven 42 client write. The admitted machine-readable boundary is
`config/local-web-runtime-policy.json`.

The initial native distribution path freezes that same process and UI into a PyInstaller one-folder package. PyInstaller supplies only a local launcher/runtime boundary: it does not add browser authority, an installer, privileged service, global dependency, or native UI framework. Frozen startup verifies a strict embedded path/size/SHA-256 resource manifest before serving. Native package tests compare source and frozen behavior and require token-protected model-cleanup-first shutdown. `config/portable-development-package-contract.json` is the machine-readable boundary; Tauri/Rust remains unadmitted.

The portable supply-chain boundary has two layers. Build inputs are exact-version and wheel-hash locked, while evidence collection admits only the expected platform-specific tool set. Build outputs bind the complete one-folder tree to a file inventory and archive checksums, then independently validate safe member names, regular-file shape, SBOM/runtime identity, notices, and exact source/environment provenance. This provenance makes no signature or attestation claim.

The first composition boundary is deliberately non-executable. A strict engine-owned contract admits at most six registry-backed `read-only` workflow references, rejects renderer arguments and graph cycles, orders dependencies deterministically, and emits metadata-only intermediate plan references. Cancellation ends before plan artifacts are emitted. The result always denies process, filesystem, network, approval-grant, and machine-modification authority; executable composition is a separate future admission.

The update boundary remains outside the portable runtime. Strict offline
policies validate immutable release metadata, manifest and package identity,
then separately simulate compatibility, staged/post health, interrupted
activation recovery, rollback, retention, and disabled mode. The lifecycle
schema accepts no raw path, URL, executable, argument, environment, approval,
or renderer evidence. Its transitions are counterfactual review output and
every network, filesystem, process, installation, activation, cleanup, and
machine-effect flag remains false. No portable or browser route invokes these
policies.

The optional Milestone 22B desktop architecture adds a Tauri 2 shell without replacing these contracts:

```text
Bundled React/TypeScript UI
        |
        v
Tauri capability allowlist and native path selection
        |
        v
versioned typed stdin/stdout IPC
        |
        v
packaged Haven 42 engine sidecar
        |
        v
capability registry -> workflow registry -> existing tested engines
```

The optional desktop path loads no remote UI code, exposes no generic shell bridge, and listens on no TCP port. It cannot inherit local-web evidence. Windows, Linux, and macOS launchers, webviews, sidecars, packages, signing, updates, and uninstall behavior are promoted independently.

The broader product-navigation slice is defined by `config/ui-navigation-contract.json` and rendered as framework-neutral state by `scripts/build-ui-view-model.py`. That full-navigation model still exposes no executable path, endpoint, approval token, or execution authority; its `runtimeAdmitted` and `executionEnabled` values remain false. The smaller admitted local-web chat runtime is governed independently by `config/local-web-runtime-policy.json`.

The future native-owned authority is separately modeled by `config/native-bridge-boundary-contract.json` and `scripts/native-bridge-boundary-policy.py`. Its 55 offline cases cover canonical path grants, protected roots, external-link allowlisting, approval replay, sidecar lifecycle, environment filtering, cancellation ownership, and privilege rejection. This policy starts no process and grants no authority; it complements the 46 engine-side IPC cases but is not native implementation evidence. See `docs/native-bridge-boundary-evidence.md`.

## Repository Layers

### Project Documentation

Top-level markdown files define the product contract, architecture, roadmap, style conventions, implementation tasks, decisions, and release notes.

These files explain why the pack exists and how contributors should evolve it.

### Agent Surface Configuration

`.continue/config.yaml` is the intended entry point for the current Continue integration.

It should eventually define:

- Local model configuration
- Context providers
- Prompt references
- Rule references
- Agent or mode wiring, where supported
- MCP integration points, when implemented

### Agents

`.continue/agents` contains role-specific assistant definitions.

Agents should describe durable professional behavior, responsibilities, boundaries, and expected outputs. They should not duplicate every task instruction from prompts or every standard from rules.

Initial agents:

- `senior-engineer.md`
- `architect.md`
- `security-engineer.md`

Secondary agents:

- `reviewer.md`
- `performance.md`
- `documentation.md`
- `product-manager.md`

### Prompts

`.continue/prompts` contains task-specific workflows.

Prompts should define:

- When to use the workflow
- What context to gather
- How to reason about the task
- Expected output format
- Risk checks and verification steps

Prompts should reference rules by concept, but should avoid copying entire rule files.

### Rules

`.continue/rules` contains reusable engineering standards.

Rules should be concise, enforceable, and broadly applicable. They should define expectations for quality, security, maintainability, testing, logging, API design, and framework usage.

Rules should avoid task-specific instructions that belong in prompts.

### Project Profiles And Optional Rule Activation

`config/project-profile-rules.json` defines deterministic ecosystem signals.
The cross-platform `get-project-profile` scripts inspect relative filenames,
emit a sanitized project profile, and select optional language rule-pack IDs.

During project-local installation, selected sources from
`.continue/rule-packs/` are copied into
`.continue/rules/active-language-<id>.md`. Unmatched source packs remain
inactive. Shared-assets mode skips this project-specific step because one
central asset folder can serve repositories with different ecosystems.

### Templates

`.continue/templates` contains structured output formats for artifacts that may be committed or shared.

Templates should make review outputs consistent and easy to scan.

### Capability Evidence

`config/capability-evidence-contract.json` defines Capability Evidence Contract
v2, and `config/evidence-catalog.tsv` stores sanitized records. Capability
readiness is keyed by surface, surface version, provider, model, operating
system, operation, and validation mode.

Recommendation and reporting consumers aggregate duplicate keys to the most
conservative status while retaining provenance. They do not inherit write
readiness across agent surfaces, operations, or operating systems.

### Workflow Orchestration

`config/workflows.json` provides stable workflow IDs and platform entry points.
`config/workflow-envelope-contract.json` defines schema-v1 requests and
execution responses for the PowerShell and native Linux/macOS dispatchers.

The envelope reports accepted, progress, warning, result, and error events.
Argument values and child output are omitted by default so future UI callers
do not casually persist local paths, endpoints, or repository output. Existing
direct CLI dispatcher behavior remains supported.

The onboarding/navigation family preserves three beginner-facing commands but
shares non-domain mechanics. `scripts/OnboardingGuidance.psm1` owns catalog
loading, workflow lookup, platform command rendering, and report output for
PowerShell. The Linux/macOS wrappers delegate argument routing to
`scripts/onboarding-guidance.shared.sh`. Full native rendering for these
informational views remains a known portability gap; native validation and
installer workflows are unaffected and continue to require no PowerShell.

## Responsibility Boundaries

- `config.yaml` wires the pack together.
- Agents define role behavior.
- Prompts define task flow.
- Rules define standards.
- Templates define durable output shape.
- Capability evidence defines what a specific surface/model/environment operation has actually proven.
- Project profiles define which optional language rules a target repository activates and the filename evidence supporting that decision.
- The language workflow validation matrix maps optional rule packs to medium-complexity fixtures and required operations while keeping unexecuted editor/model evidence explicitly pending.
- Workflow registry and envelope contracts define stable, versioned automation boundaries without owning workflow business logic.
- Top-level docs define project intent and governance.

## Dependency Policy

The pack uses a simple dependency direction:

```text
config.yaml
  -> agents
  -> prompts
  -> rules
  -> templates

top-level docs govern all layers but are not runtime dependencies
```

Allowed references:

- `config.yaml` may reference rules, prompts, docs, context providers, models, and future MCP servers.
- Agents may reference rules and prompts conceptually.
- Prompts may reference rules and templates conceptually.
- Rules should not depend on prompts or agents.
- Templates should not depend on prompts, agents, or rules.
- Top-level docs may describe any layer.

This keeps reusable policy below workflow orchestration and prevents circular instruction dependencies.

## Domain Language

The project domain is local-first engineering workflow guidance.

- Pack: the complete reusable engineering-agent bundle in this repository.
- Agent surface: the editor, CLI, or runtime environment that loads the pack assets and executes model/tool workflows.
- Agent: a role-specific assistant definition.
- Prompt: a task-specific workflow that can be invoked by a user.
- Rule: reusable engineering guidance applied across workflows.
- Template: structured output for a durable artifact or review.
- Finding: a concrete issue identified during review.
- Recommendation: an actionable change or decision proposal.
- Workflow: a repeatable task sequence such as repository discovery, code review, or security review.
- Model lane: a purpose-specific local model role such as WRITE SAFE, PLAN ONLY, or DEEP REVIEW.
- Selection policy: a versioned scoring contract that requires exact capability evidence and ranks eligible models for one model lane.
- Model-fit profile: a versioned, reviewable memory-planning assumption for an exact model tag, including quantization assumption, weights, context-sensitive cache, runtime overhead, architecture, and reserve.
- Quantization plan: a no-effect decision that binds immutable source identity, license, target runtime/format, local hardware inputs, storage, disclosures, and either an exact trusted artifact, a possible local derivative, or no safe recommendation.
- Quantized-artifact manifest: a local lifecycle record for exact input/output hashes, pinned tools, recipe parameters, runtime/hardware evidence, validation, activation, rollback, and cleanup.

## Initial Architecture Decisions

- The pack is local-first and should work with Ollama before cloud model assumptions are introduced.
- Continue remains the first supported agent surface, but the project should avoid coupling reusable guidance to Continue-only behavior when a portable abstraction is practical.
- The first ecosystem focus is .NET and ASP.NET Core, with enterprise-grade guidance kept useful for smaller projects too.
- Clean Architecture guidance should be practical and testable, not ceremonial.
- Security and performance review guidance should be built into early milestones.
- MCP and SonarQube support should be documented as integration targets until implemented.
- Tool-enabled project changes should be treated as an approved execution mode, not the default review posture.
- Local model selection should remain hardware-aware but portable, keeping machine-specific endpoints and hardware details out of committed shared config.
- Model-lane eligibility must require exact surface, version, provider, operating system, operation, and validation-mode evidence; scores may rank eligible models but must not manufacture missing capability evidence.
- WRITE SAFE selection should favor validated reliability and VRAM headroom, while planning and review may favor greater fitting capacity after exact lane evidence is established.
- Curated model-fit profiles should take precedence over name-derived estimates, disclose every assumption, and keep unknown tags labeled as low-confidence rather than implying measured compatibility.
- Trusted compatible pre-quantized artifacts should be preferred over local conversion; equal bit counts never imply format, kernel, runtime, or accelerator compatibility.
- Quantization planning may inspect local hardware but must omit persistent identity fields, perform no network/download/conversion/activation effects, and keep profiles and model artifacts out of commits.
- Future UI callers should use stable workflow IDs and the versioned envelope rather than invoking or parsing individual script families directly.

## Open Questions

- Should the current local file references in `.continue/config.yaml` be adjusted after validation in Continue?
- Which Ollama models should be recommended for larger enterprise repositories?
- Which additional agent surfaces should be validated first after Continue?
- Should agents be further integrated as native Continue agent files if the target Continue version supports richer agent packaging?
- How should SonarQube findings be provided to the assistant: pasted reports, MCP, CLI output, or another integration?
- Which MCP servers are in scope for the first integration milestone?
- Should prompt examples be added as committed fixtures or generated on demand during release validation?
- What tool execution surface should be considered the supported path for approved project changes?
- Which hardware signals are reliable enough to drive dynamic local model selection across Windows, Linux, and macOS?
