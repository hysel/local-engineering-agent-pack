# Agent Surface Options

## Purpose

This document tracks possible agent surfaces for the Local Engineering Agent Pack.

Continue is the first supported surface because it is the current validated path for local Ollama workflows, prompt loading, rule loading, shared asset installation, and approved-write testing. Other open-source tools may become useful targets, but they must be validated before they are recommended for real project changes.

## What Counts As An Agent Surface

An agent surface is the editor, CLI, or runtime that connects the pack assets to a model and to tools.

Examples:

- An editor extension that can read files, apply diffs, and ask for approval.
- A terminal coding assistant that can inspect a Git repository and propose patches.
- A self-hosted agent platform that can run workflows against a mounted workspace.

## Compatibility Matrix

This matrix is a support boundary, not a popularity ranking. A surface can be a good candidate and still be blocked for real edits until this pack has evidence that it reads the right workspace, targets the right files, and passes external verification.

| Surface | Surface type | Current validation level | Current pack support | Approved-write position | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Continue | VS Code-compatible extension, VSCodium extension, and CLI fallback | Approved-write ready for the validated local setup | Supported first path | Allowed only after the read-only, read-content, current-folder, and scoped write smoke tests pass in the user's actual setup | Existing config, install scripts, shared asset mode, validation docs, model testing, and approved-write guidance target Continue today. |
| Cline | VS Code-compatible editor agent | Read-only validated and disposable write-smoke validated for generated Python sample with `qwen3-coder:30b` at 16k context | Read/write validation guide and sanitized evidence available | Real-project approved-write blocked | Use `docs/cline-readonly-validation.md` and `examples/cline-readonly-validation.md`; a minimal README write smoke test passed, but real-project approved-write remains blocked until a realistic scoped edit passes external verification. |
| Aider | Git-aware CLI coding assistant | Candidate | Not packaged yet | Blocked | Likely needs CLI-specific prompt bundles and a patch/diff workflow rather than Continue-style config. |
| Kilo Code | VS Code-compatible editor agent | Candidate | Not packaged yet | Blocked | Needs config loading, tool behavior, approval flow, and write-safety validation before recommendation. |
| OpenCode | Terminal or IDE-oriented coding agent | Candidate | Not packaged yet | Blocked | Needs repository discovery, local model/tool behavior, and deterministic output verification against generated samples. |
| OpenHands | Self-hosted/platform-style agent runtime | Candidate | Not packaged yet | Blocked | More platform-like than editor-focused; needs workspace mount, sandbox, secret, and trust-boundary review before write mode. |
| Roo Code | VS Code-compatible editor agent | Candidate | Not packaged yet | Blocked | Worth tracking as another open-source editor-agent option, but no pack-specific validation exists yet. |

Candidate means "worth testing", not "approved for edits".

## Validation Levels

Use the same labels for every surface:

| Level | Meaning | Minimum evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Candidate | The surface looks relevant, but this pack has not validated it yet. | Surface name, expected operating mode, and reason it may fit the pack. |
| Read-only validated | The surface can discover the opened repository, list files, read target files, and produce grounded output without modifying files. | Sanitized transcript or summary with exact inspected filenames, model/provider, OS, tool permission state, and failure signals. |
| Plan validated | The surface can produce implementation plans that preserve project constraints and pass deterministic output verification. | Read-only evidence plus a plan output checked for filename fidelity, no unsupported claims, rollback, tests, and docs impact. |
| Write smoke-test validated | The surface can make one minimal approved edit in a disposable repository and pass external verification. | Read-only evidence plus a minimal disposable-repo write test showing exactly one changed file through `git status`, `git diff --check`, and direct file-content verification outside the agent surface. |
| Approved-write ready | The surface can make realistic scoped edits only after approval, target the correct file, avoid duplicate writes, and pass external shell or Git verification. | Read-only, plan, and write-smoke evidence plus a realistic disposable-repo scoped edit showing changed files through `git status`, `git diff --check`, and direct file-content verification outside the agent surface. |

Do not mark a surface approved-write ready from model claims alone. Verify the changed files outside the agent surface.

## Evidence Fields

Every surface validation record should capture:

- Surface name and version.
- Editor, CLI, or runtime host.
- Operating system.
- Model name, provider, endpoint type, and whether the model supports tools in that surface.
- Config source: project-local assets, centralized shared assets, global config, or generated local config.
- MCP state, if any.
- Prompt or workflow tested.
- Tool permissions: read-only, ask-before-write, approved write, or unavailable.
- Exact files inspected or changed, sanitized when necessary.
- External verification commands and results.
- Failure signal, using the documented labels when possible.

## Portability Rules

- Keep reusable prompts, rules, templates, examples, and validation evidence independent of Continue-specific syntax where practical.
- Keep Continue-specific configuration in `.continue` until another surface has a tested packaging format.
- Do not weaken safety rules to support another tool.
- Do not commit private endpoints, local paths, tokens, raw transcripts, or customer/project names when recording validation evidence.
- Treat local model behavior as surface-specific. A model that works in one editor or CLI may fail in another.
- Treat approved-write support as surface plus model plus editor/runtime plus operating-system specific.

## Recommended Next Evaluation

Start with one non-Continue surface in read-only mode. The first documented path is Cline read-only validation in `docs/cline-readonly-validation.md`.

Suggested order:

1. Generate a local sample repository with `docs/sample-repository-factory.md`.
2. Install or configure the candidate surface without write permissions if possible.
3. Run repository discovery.
4. Confirm actual file reads, not guessed summaries.
5. Run deterministic output verification on the generated response.
6. Record sanitized evidence in the wiki and repository docs.
7. Only then test scoped writes against a disposable repository.

## Non-Enterprise Use

The default path should stay friendly for users who are not in a corporate environment:

- Simple local Ollama setup.
- Conservative starter model.
- Short commands for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Clear warnings before write mode.
- Optional advanced integrations instead of required enterprise tooling.

Enterprise teams can still layer on MCP, SonarQube, stricter validation evidence, review gates, and release governance.
