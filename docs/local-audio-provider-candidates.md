# Local Audio Provider Candidates

Recorded 2026-07-22 from official upstream repositories and model cards. This is documentation-only candidate evidence. It does not promote a provider or add `audio.music.create`, scripts, adapters, workflows, configuration, or installer assets.

## ACE-Step 1.5

The current application release is `v0.1.8`, resolving to Git commit `dce621408bee8c31b4fcf4811682eb9359e1bc94`. The separately versioned official `ACE-Step/Ace-Step1.5` model repository was observed at revision `19671f406d603126926c1b7e2adc169acbcade22`, with 10,079,024,720 bytes of LFS-managed blobs.

| Baseline file | Bytes | Published SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `acestep-v15-turbo/model.safetensors` | 4,787,825,604 | `3f6e0797fad420a39bd33979eb6e840e30989e34a3794e843d23b60ec6e422d7` |
| `acestep-5Hz-lm-1.7B/model.safetensors` | 3,708,521,528 | `f161689da73e5ecefa28ff780d51c2d92a00f056d021d7933c779ed5c6cd7db8` |
| `vae/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors` | 337,431,388 | `da17edb604c40deaf09e9b24974e590d1ca83a374070e5d0884cfa4bed9a99b0` |

The project and model card declare MIT licensing and describe text-to-music, lyrics/vocals, instrumental generation, reference audio, cover, repaint, and related editing operations. Upstream currently claims Python 3.11–3.12 plus CUDA, ROCm, Intel XPU, Apple Silicon MLX/MPS, and CPU paths. These are claims, not Haven 42 evidence; every OS/accelerator/operation remains candidate-only.

The first proposed evaluation cell remains Linux CUDA using the pinned REST API. Instrumental and vocal generation must pass separately, including WAV/FLAC decoding, requested duration, sample rate, channels, non-silence, clipping, cancellation, forced recovery, retained-history cleanup, and uninstall.

## Stable Audio 3

Stable Audio 3 uses the Stability AI Community License and redistributes T5Gemma components under their own terms. Model access is gated and commercial use must be evaluated against the current Stability licensing program; this is a product-policy constraint, not merely attribution text.

| Candidate | Model revision | LFS bytes | Primary weight SHA-256 | Intended evaluation |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Small SFX | `ae12755283df9d62ca39a9b050a39a0b607b8c20` | 3,493,474,189 | `ed9cf1b6172f1a8c2921a9560c21109ff3239524563ced9dce6dcdef41e2f515` | Sound effects, editing, continuation |
| Medium | `27b5a21b791b1b033d193a9e1e3ce78493f102f9` | 10,445,205,909 | `48d9c65e290e7bcd5194e0633bfc2424a59ee9683f5c2d58762d997b7d8ce0b5` | Music, sound effects, editing, longer duration |

Both recorded profiles use `t5gemma-b-b-ul2/model.safetensors` at 1,183,022,944 bytes with SHA-256 `9b05ea5a4f211d023832f706fb2c0e83e4fc721b6da35ab69ceb0b55eb7800d3`.

The official Small Music repository is visible but gated metadata could not be resolved anonymously on 2026-07-22. Its exact immutable revision, files, and hashes therefore remain an explicit blocker; Haven 42 must not substitute the Small SFX revision or infer identity from the 0.6B parameter label.

## Admission Decision

No audio provider is promoted. ACE-Step is ready for an external Linux CUDA evaluation when suitable disposable capacity is approved. Stable Audio remains gated by authenticated model acquisition plus exact license review. The shared consent boundary is defined in `docs/generative-media-consent-policy.md`.
