# Haven 42

**Your private, local AI station.**

Haven 42 is an evidence-gated, local-first AI workbench for software engineering and general-purpose tasks on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It was previously named Local Engineering Agent Pack. Because the project had no external users at rebrand time, product-specific paths and commands use the Haven 42 identity without a legacy compatibility layer.

Today, the maintained engineering surfaces are Continue, Aider, and OpenCode. Repository-optional local chat, writing, and summarization have a validated Ollama adapter, and local image generation has a validated Linux ComfyUI/SDXL path. The local web UI is planned, native desktop image profiles remain evidence-gated, and music/video candidates remain documentation-only. Quantization contracts, sanitized profiling, and trusted-artifact selection are implemented, and the first exact Linux NVIDIA Ollama comparison has passed without admitting a conversion path. OpenHands is documentation-only while its isolated validation boundary remains unimplemented.

Failed or retired integrations do not ship scripts, harnesses, wrappers, configuration, workflows, or active catalog entries. Fixture-backed cross-platform contracts do not broaden native runtime or hardware claims.

## Current Roadmap

- Milestone 22 — planned local web UI and task composition.
- Milestone 23 — native local image generation in progress; Linux ComfyUI/SDXL validated.
- Milestone 24 — immutable audio candidate inventory and consent policy complete; live evaluation open.
- Milestone 25 — immutable video candidate inventory and consent policy complete; live evaluation open.
- Milestone 26 — foundation complete and the first Linux NVIDIA Ollama comparison passed; broader workload and platform cells remain open.

## Support Model

Every agent integration is evaluated outside the shipped pack first. It enters the repository only after its exact software version passes installation, configuration, health, read-only, planning, write-smoke, scoped-edit, cleanup, sanitization, and cross-platform promotion gates. A failed evaluation produces only a concise sanitized decision record.

Model and tool behavior remains specific to the agent surface, model, operating system, and runtime. Always begin read-only and independently verify approved writes with Git and the target repository's own tests.

## Current Release

The current release line is `0.3.0`. Work after that release remains under `Unreleased` until a new version is deliberately prepared and exact-SHA hosted CI succeeds.

The repository is available at [hysel/haven-42](https://github.com/hysel/haven-42).
