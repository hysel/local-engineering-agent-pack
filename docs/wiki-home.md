# Haven 42

**Your private, local AI station.**

Haven 42 is an evidence-gated, local-first AI workbench for software engineering and general-purpose tasks on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Product-specific paths, commands, packages, and documentation use the Haven 42 identity consistently.

Today, the maintained engineering surfaces are Continue, Aider, and OpenCode. The runnable local web application begins with keyboard-accessible Guided setup, Connect existing setup, and Explore paths. Guided setup performs an explicit bounded read-only hardware/software scan and builds a disabled, zero-effect setup plan; it does not install software. The chat-first workspace then provides pinned navigation, compact provider/system setup, automatically classified local/LAN Ollama connection, exact-digest model choices for chat/writing/summarization, provider token/timing details, advanced manual overrides, strict typed progress/warning/result/error envelopes, memory-only failed-input recovery with no automatic retry, typed no-file-written results, read-only provider-health/evidence/update status, and bounded idle/lifecycle cleanup on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Unknown or digest-mismatched installed models remain unverified and visibly warned when used, and missing recommendations never trigger an automatic download. Software exposes only plan-only registered read-only workflows with no renderer arguments or process execution. Images admits only the promoted Linux ComfyUI/SDXL profile through a loopback endpoint, clears API history, returns a browser-memory PNG, and discloses provider retention before generation. Native desktop image profiles remain evidence-gated, and music/video candidates remain documentation-only.

Failed or retired integrations do not ship scripts, harnesses, wrappers, configuration, workflows, or active catalog entries. Fixture-backed cross-platform contracts do not broaden native runtime or hardware claims.

## Current Roadmap

- Milestone 22 — local text, provider metrics, software planning, bounded effect-free composition plans, promoted Linux images, and portable development packages are runnable; workflow execution, executable composition, activated updates, and optional Tauri packaging remain independently gated.
- Milestone 23 — native local image generation in progress; Linux ComfyUI/SDXL validated.
- Milestone 24 — immutable audio candidate inventory and consent policy complete; live evaluation open.
- Milestone 25 — immutable video candidate inventory and consent policy complete; live evaluation open.
- Milestone 26 — exact Linux NVIDIA and Windows AMD Ollama comparisons passed; llama.cpp CUDA passed on Linux NVIDIA and HIP passed on Windows AMD, Vulkan failed the patch gate, Intel is parked pending hardware, and broader cells remain open.

## Support Model

Every agent integration is evaluated outside the shipped pack first. It enters the repository only after its exact software version passes installation, configuration, health, read-only, planning, write-smoke, scoped-edit, cleanup, sanitization, and cross-platform promotion gates. A failed evaluation produces only a concise sanitized decision record.

Model and tool behavior remains specific to the agent surface, model, operating system, and runtime. Always begin read-only and independently verify approved writes with Git and the target repository's own tests.

## Current Release

The current release line is `0.3.0`. Work after that release remains under `Unreleased` until a new version is deliberately prepared and exact-SHA hosted CI succeeds.

The repository is available at [hysel/haven-42](https://github.com/hysel/haven-42).

## Security

Provider endpoints are trust-scoped and bounded, mutable automated installers are blocked, CI actions are commit-pinned, and vulnerabilities should be reported privately through the repository security policy. See `docs/provider-endpoint-security.md`.
