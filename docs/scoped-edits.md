# Scoped Edits From Approved Plans

## Purpose

This guide explains how to turn an approved implementation plan into small, reviewable changes in the project being worked on.

Use this after:

- `docs/tool-use-modes.md`
- `docs/approved-tool-backed-changes.md`

## Simple Rule

Do not ask for broad implementation after a large plan.

Instead, choose one small part of the approved plan and ask the assistant to edit only that part.

Good wording:

```text
Implement step 1 from the approved plan only. Keep the change scoped to the listed files. Do not make unrelated cleanup changes.
```

## Before Editing

Check the repository state:

```powershell
git status --short --branch
```

If the project has existing uncommitted changes, identify them first. The assistant should not overwrite or revert changes it did not make.

Confirm the approved plan includes:

- The goal
- Affected files
- Validation steps
- Rollback steps
- Definition of done

If any of these are missing, ask for a better plan before allowing edits.

Before editing, the assistant must successfully read the exact files it will
change. If it can only list files but cannot read file contents, stop and fix
tool access before approving implementation.

## Step 1: Pick One Slice

A good slice is small enough to review in one diff.

Good slices:

- Add one missing document section.
- Update one prompt.
- Add one focused validation check.
- Change one config option and its matching documentation.
- Add one test fixture and one expected-output note.

Too broad:

- "Implement the whole roadmap."
- "Refactor the architecture."
- "Fix all warnings."
- "Update all docs."
- "Modernize the project."

## Step 2: Name The Files

When possible, tell the assistant which files it may change.

Example:

```text
Implement step 1 only.

Allowed files:
- README.md
- docs/tool-use-modes.md
- TODO.md

Do not modify any other files.
```

If the assistant discovers another file is needed, it should explain why before editing it.

## Step 3: Set Boundaries

Add clear limits to the request.

Useful boundaries:

```text
Do not change dependencies.
Do not change CI.
Do not change authentication or authorization.
Do not rename or delete files.
Do not commit.
```

For code work, add:

```text
Keep existing patterns. Add or update tests only for the changed behavior.
```

For documentation work, add:

```text
Keep the wording beginner-friendly. Avoid private paths, private IP addresses, secrets, and project-specific output.
```

## Step 4: Ask For The Edit

Use a request like this:

```text
Implement step 1 from the approved plan only.

Allowed files:
- path/to/file-a
- path/to/file-b

Do not modify other files.
After editing, run the relevant validation and explain the diff.
Do not commit.
```

This gives the assistant enough freedom to work while keeping the change reviewable.

## Step 5: Review The Diff

After the edit, inspect the changed files:

```powershell
git status --short
git diff --check
git diff
```

Look for:

- Files changed outside the approved scope
- Unrelated formatting churn
- Private machine details
- Missing validation
- Missing documentation updates
- Broad behavior changes hidden inside a small task

If the diff is too large, stop and ask the assistant to explain why.

## Step 6: Validate

Run the smallest useful validation first.

For this pack:

```powershell
.\scripts\validate-pack.ps1
```

For .NET projects:

```powershell
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

For Node projects:

```powershell
npm test
npm run build
```

If validation cannot run, record why and list manual checks.

## Step 7: Decide What Comes Next

After review and validation, choose one:

- Ask for a small fix.
- Approve the next plan slice.
- Commit the change.
- Stop and roll back the assistant's last change.

Do not continue stacking edits if the current diff has not been reviewed.

## Safe Prompt Template

Use this template for most approved edits:

```text
Implement this approved plan slice only:

[paste or describe the specific step]

Allowed files:
- [file 1]
- [file 2]

Boundaries:
- Do not modify other files.
- Do not rename or delete files.
- Do not change dependencies, CI, authentication, authorization, or deployment.
- Do not commit.

After editing:
- Run the relevant validation.
- Explain each changed file.
- Call out anything you could not validate.
```

## When To Stop

Stop and review manually if:

- The assistant wants to change many unrelated files.
- The assistant prints raw JSON tool calls instead of running tools.
- The assistant cannot read the target files.
- The assistant proposes changes from typical framework patterns without citing file evidence.
- Continue reports filepath resolution errors.
- Validation fails in a way the assistant cannot explain.
- The change touches secrets, auth, deployment, or production data.

## Rollback Guidance

Prefer targeted rollback.

Safe options:

- Ask the assistant to undo only its own last edit.
- Restore one file from source control.
- Create a patch from the diff before experimenting further.
- Commit known-good work before starting another risky slice.

Avoid destructive repository-wide reset commands unless you are certain you want to discard all local changes.
