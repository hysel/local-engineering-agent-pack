# Solution Architecture Review

This review checks whether each milestone has a complete solution set: user entry point, configuration or workflow path, validation evidence, safety boundary, and remaining enhancement path. It also reconciles milestone status against the stricter user requirement that each tracked agent surface should have comparable install, configure, and test coverage before being treated as fully complete.

## Review Standard

Each milestone is considered complete only when it has:

- A documented user or maintainer entry point.
- A configuration, workflow, script, or evidence path that implements the milestone.
- Validation coverage in `scripts/test-pack.ps1` or equivalent committed evidence.
- Safety guidance for local-only config, approval boundaries, sanitization, or rollback when relevant.
- Remaining work moved to a future evidence or enhancement section instead of hidden inside a completed milestone.

## Previous Chat Interpretation

This audit applies the stricter completion standard from the maintainer discussion:

- A milestone is not complete just because documentation, scaffolding, or a candidate path exists.
- When a milestone covers agent surfaces, every tracked surface must have comparable `Install`, `Configure`, and `Test` coverage before the milestone can be marked fully complete.
- If parity is not possible yet, the milestone must stay `Partial` or `In Progress`, and the exact blocker must stay visible in `TODO.md`.
- Generated sample repositories can satisfy validation coverage when real repositories are not available, but real-repository runs remain future evidence expansion unless the milestone explicitly requires them.
- Hosted GitHub Actions status must be checked after pushed commits before treating the work as closed.

## Milestone Audit

| Milestone | Current status | Solution set status | Architect notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1: Minimum Usable Pack | Complete | Complete | Core Continue config, rules, prompts, agents, templates, README, and validation are present. |
| 2: Enterprise Review Depth | Complete | Complete | Review prompts, role agents, SonarQube guidance, examples, and decision records are in place. |
| 3: Tooling And Integration | Complete | Complete | MCP and SonarQube paths are documented; deeper integrations remain optional evidence expansion. |
| 4: Runtime Validation And CI | Complete | Complete | CI, runtime context generation, runtime docs, and validation records exist. |
| 5: Prompt Quality Hardening | Complete | Complete | Fixtures, pass/fail expectations, prompt metadata checks, and banned-output guidance are covered. |
| 6: Applied Tooling And Adaptive Models | Complete | Complete | Tool modes, approved-write guidance, scoped edits, hardware-aware model selection, and local config safety exist. |
| 7: Cross-Platform Contributor Experience | Complete | Complete | Windows, Linux, and macOS validation/test paths are documented and tested. |
| 8: Real Repository Validation | Complete | Complete with future expansion | Pack and application-style validation are recorded; more real repositories require suitable targets. |
| 9: Distribution And Install Experience | Complete | Complete | Install/update, dry-run, backup, shared assets, global config, and validation paths are implemented. |
| 10: ARM And Apple Silicon Model Support | Complete | Complete | Architecture detection and ARM/MLX guidance are documented and tested for current scope. |
| 11: Editor Surface Compatibility | Complete | Complete | VS Code-compatible and VSCodium validation, duplicate-rule handling, and CLI fallback are documented. |
| 12: Model Tool-Use Validation Evidence | Complete | Complete | Model lanes, preflight tooling, evidence templates, approved-write boundaries, and installer support are covered. |
| 13: Broader Multi-Repository Validation | Complete | Complete with future expansion | Real legacy .NET plus generated category evidence satisfy completion; more real repos remain future evidence expansion. |
| 14: Agent Surface Portability And Broader Audience | Partial | Complete for positioning, partial for full cross-agent parity | Surface matrix, promotion gates, setup paths, config-bundle policy, and non-Continue evidence are documented; comparable install/configure/test support is not complete for every tracked surface. |
| 15: Multi-Language Engineering Support | Complete | Complete with staged maturity | Python and TypeScript workflow evidence is complete for current scope; broader ecosystem promotion remains evidence-gated. |
| 16: Sample Repository Factory | Complete | Complete | Cross-platform sample generation, fixture coverage, runtime context, and sanitized evidence are covered. |
| 17: Agent Surface Compatibility Validation | Partial | Complete for Cline and Aider, partial for all tracked surfaces | Cline and Aider meet current evidence gates; Roo Code, Kilo Code, OpenCode, and OpenHands do not yet have full live validation evidence. |
| 18: Language Rule Packs | In Progress | Partial | Optional rule packs and static evidence exist, but editor/model workflow failures remain for Java, Go, Rust, SQL, and Infrastructure samples. |
| 19: Installer Profiles, Evidence Catalog, And Release Packaging | Partial | Complete for Continue, partial for cross-agent parity | Current Continue profiles, evidence catalog, and packaging are complete; actual install/configure/test script parity is missing for non-Continue surfaces and must remain visible until evidence-backed automation exists. |
| 20: Hardware-Aware Model And Config Automation | In Progress | Partial | Recommendation, dashboard, menu, dispatcher, health, cleanup, release readiness, and the unified UI design exist; deeper consolidation and UI implementation remain future work. |

## Input-Dependent Decisions

These should stay on `TODO.md` until the user or project owner provides input:

- Suitable non-generated repositories for additional real-repository validation.
- Confirmed command shapes for Roo Code, Kilo Code, and OpenCode wrapper validation.
- Safe validation boundary for OpenHands as a platform-style agent.
- Whether surface-specific install/configure profiles should be prioritized before more non-Continue evidence exists.
- Whether Milestone 19 should require actual install/configure/test scripts for Cline and Aider before being marked complete again.
- Scope and priority for a unified starter-toolkit web UI.
- Whether external wiki publishing is required for the next release.

## Enhancement Recommendations

- Keep Milestones 18-20 open until their remaining evidence-gated or design-dependent work is complete.
- Prefer strengthening deterministic remediation for `EMPTY_MODEL_OUTPUT` and filename-drift failures before promoting more language rule packs.
- Keep beginner navigation centered on `docs/agent-pack-menu.md`, with script details in `docs/script-reference-appendix.md`.
- Continue using `config/agent-surface-solutions.json` as the install/configure/test source of truth for agent surfaces.
- Keep future work in clearly named TODO sections when it depends on user input, external tools, or non-generated repositories.
