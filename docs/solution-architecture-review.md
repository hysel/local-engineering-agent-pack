# Solution Architecture Review

This review checks whether each milestone has a complete solution set: user entry point, configuration or workflow path, validation evidence, safety boundary, and remaining enhancement path. Supported-surface completion requires comparable install, configure, and test coverage; candidate, quarantined, and historical surfaces remain visible without being represented as supported.

## Review Standard

Each milestone is considered complete only when it has:

- A documented user or maintainer entry point.
- A configuration, workflow, script, or evidence path that implements the milestone.
- Validation coverage in `scripts/test-pack.ps1` or equivalent committed evidence.
- Safety guidance for local-only config, approval boundaries, sanitization, or rollback when relevant.
- Remaining work moved to a future evidence or enhancement section instead of hidden inside a completed milestone.

## Previous Chat Interpretation

This audit applies the stricter completion standard from the maintainer discussion:

- A milestone is not complete just because documentation, scaffolding, or a candidate path exists.
- When a milestone covers agent surfaces, every promoted supported surface must have comparable `Install`, `Configure`, and `Test` coverage before the milestone can be marked fully complete.
- Candidate, quarantined, and historical surfaces must expose their exact status and blocker but do not count as supported-surface parity.
- Generated sample repositories can satisfy validation coverage when real repositories are not available, but real-repository runs remain future evidence expansion unless the milestone explicitly requires them.
- Hosted GitHub Actions status must be checked after pushed commits before treating the work as closed.

## Milestone Audit

| Milestone | Current status | Solution set status | Architect notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1: Minimum Usable Pack | Complete | Complete | Core Continue config, rules, prompts, agents, templates, README, and validation are present. |
| 2: Enterprise Review Depth | Complete | Complete | Review prompts, role agents, SonarQube guidance, examples, and decision records are in place. |
| 3: Tooling And Integration | Complete | Complete | MCP and SonarQube paths are documented; deeper integrations remain optional evidence expansion. |
| 4: Runtime Validation And CI | Complete | Complete | CI, runtime context generation, runtime docs, and validation records exist. |
| 5: Prompt Quality Hardening | Complete | Complete | Fixtures, pass/fail expectations, prompt metadata checks, and banned-output guidance are covered. |
| 6: Applied Tooling And Adaptive Models | Complete | Complete | Tool modes, approved-write guidance, scoped edits, hardware-aware model selection, and local config safety exist. |
| 7: Cross-Platform Contributor Experience | Complete | Complete | Windows, Linux, and macOS validation/test paths are documented and tested. |
| 8: Real Repository Validation | Complete | Complete with future expansion | Pack and application-style validation are recorded; more real repositories require suitable targets. |
| 9: Distribution And Install Experience | Complete | Complete | Install/update, dry-run, backup, shared assets, global config, and validation paths are implemented. |
| 10: ARM And Apple Silicon Model Support | Complete | Complete | Architecture detection and ARM/MLX guidance are documented and tested for current scope. |
| 11: Editor Surface Compatibility | Complete | Complete | VS Code-compatible and VSCodium validation, duplicate-rule handling, and CLI fallback are documented. |
| 12: Model Tool-Use Validation Evidence | Complete | Complete | Model lanes, preflight tooling, evidence templates, approved-write boundaries, and installer support are covered. |
| 13: Broader Multi-Repository Validation | Complete | Complete with future expansion | Real legacy .NET plus generated category evidence satisfy completion; more real repos remain future evidence expansion. |
| 14: Agent Surface Portability And Broader Audience | Complete | Complete for positioning and support-tier governance | Surface matrix, promotion gates, setup paths, config-bundle policy, and non-Continue evidence are documented; candidate, quarantined, and historical surfaces cannot be mistaken for supported options. |
| 15: Multi-Language Engineering Support | Complete | Complete with staged maturity | Python and TypeScript workflow evidence is complete for current scope; broader ecosystem promotion remains evidence-gated. |
| 16: Sample Repository Factory | Complete | Complete | Cross-platform sample generation, fixture coverage, runtime context, and sanitized evidence are covered. |
| 17: Agent Surface Compatibility Validation | Complete | Complete for the promoted supported-surface set | Continue, Aider, and OpenCode have explicit evidence-backed validation positions. Cline and Kilo are quarantined with retained evidence/harnesses, OpenHands is a candidate with a defined isolation boundary, and Roo Code is historical. |
| 18: Language Rule Packs | Complete | Complete for the generated-fixture scope | Optional rule packs, project activation, cross-platform matrix evidence, and language-aware selection are complete; real-project/editor expansion remains separately evidence-gated. |
| 19: Installer Profiles, Evidence Catalog, And Release Packaging | Complete | Complete for the promoted supported-surface set | Capability Evidence Contract v2, Continue profiles, supported Aider and OpenCode install/configure/health/test paths, and packaging are complete. Quarantined and candidate surfaces are excluded from supported parity. |
| 20: Hardware-Aware Model And Config Automation | In Progress | Partial | Recommendation, lane-specific scoring, curated model-fit metadata, dashboard, menu, dispatcher, versioned workflow envelope, health, cleanup, release readiness, the first non-Continue adapter, and the unified UI design exist; runtime-measured fit metadata, deeper consolidation, and UI implementation remain future work. |

## Input-Dependent Decisions

These should stay on `TODO.md` until the user or project owner provides input:

- Suitable non-generated repositories for additional real-repository validation.
- A qualifying upstream Cline or Kilo change before their retained maintainer harnesses are rerun and support restoration is considered.
- Approval of a rootless isolated OpenHands implementation under the documented boundary before generated-sample validation automation is added.
- Which candidate surface, if any, should enter promotion after the current supported set.
- Scope and priority for a unified starter-toolkit web UI.
- Whether external wiki publishing is required for the next release.

## Enhancement Recommendations

- Keep Milestone 20 open until its remaining UI and evidence-driven automation work is complete.
- Prefer strengthening deterministic remediation for `EMPTY_MODEL_OUTPUT` and filename-drift failures before promoting more language rule packs.
- Keep beginner navigation centered on `docs/agent-pack-menu.md`, with script details in `docs/script-reference-appendix.md`.
- Continue using `config/agent-surface-solutions.json` as the install/configure/test source of truth for agent surfaces.
- Keep future work in clearly named TODO sections when it depends on user input, external tools, or non-generated repositories.
