# Writing Model Evaluation

Haven 42 has validated the bounded `content.write` adapter contract with `qwen3.5:9b`, but it has not run a comparative writing-quality evaluation. Adapter success proves local execution, typed Markdown output, privacy, and cleanup. It does not prove that the model is the best writer.

No candidate in this document is a product default or an admitted writing recommendation. Promotion requires an exact model artifact, digest, quantization, provider version, operating system, execution-host hardware profile, license decision, repeated performance evidence, and blind human quality review.

## Initial Candidate Matrix

| Candidate | Why evaluate it | Initial hardware note | License boundary | Current Haven 42 state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `qwen3.5:9b` | Existing control with passed chat, writing-adapter, summarization, and cleanup contracts. | Already exercised on the current Ollama path. | Reconfirm the exact Ollama artifact and upstream license at evaluation time. | Validated adapter baseline; comparative writing quality unknown. |
| `gemma3:12b` instruction-tuned Q4 | Google identifies Gemma 3 for content creation, chat, summarization, and instruction following; the Ollama 12B package is about 8.1 GB with a 128K context window. | Plausible 16 GB-class candidate with headroom; measure the actual execution host. | Gemma Terms of Use and Prohibited Use Policy require an explicit product-license review; do not label it Apache or OSI-approved. | Candidate only. |
| `mistral-small3.2:24b-instruct-2506-q4_K_M` | Mistral reports improved precise instruction following and fewer repetition errors; the Ollama artifact is Apache 2.0 and has a 128K context window. | About 15 GB before runtime overhead, so a 16 GB GPU may spill or lose useful context headroom. | Apache 2.0 for the reviewed artifact; verify the exact digest. | Candidate only; newer Mistral generations do not transfer evidence to this artifact. |
| `granite4:7b-a1b-h` | IBM lists summarization, instruction following, question answering, and multilingual dialog as intended uses; the Ollama package is about 4.2 GB. | Efficiency baseline for lower-memory systems; verify hybrid Mamba-2 runtime behavior and output quality. | Apache 2.0 for the reviewed family/artifact; verify the exact digest. | Candidate only. |

Gemma 3 27B and Mistral Small 4 may be reconsidered for larger hardware. They are not in the first 16 GB-class matrix: the Ollama Gemma 3 27B package is about 17 GB before runtime overhead, while Mistral Small 4 has 119B total parameters despite 6.5B active parameters.

## Controlled Evaluation

Use the same source material, prompts, provider settings, context limit, warm/cold policy, and output bounds for every exact candidate. Record the prompt-set revision and never use private user documents in committed fixtures.

The first suite should cover:

1. concise professional email drafting;
2. tone-preserving rewrite;
3. structured article or brief from supplied facts;
4. long-form coherence and section continuity;
5. source-grounded summarization with deliberate distractors;
6. constrained editing that must retain names, dates, numbers, and uncertainty;
7. multilingual writing only for languages represented in the claimed model support.

Blind human scoring should evaluate instruction compliance, factual retention, completeness, organization, tone, repetition, unsupported additions, and formatting. Automated checks should verify required facts, forbidden inventions, required headings, output bounds, and repeatability, but they cannot replace human writing-quality review.

Also record time to first token, generation throughput, total latency, accelerator and system memory, context actually admitted by the provider, warm-reuse behavior, idle cleanup, and final unloaded state. Run enough repetitions to distinguish a stable result from one favorable sample.

## Promotion Rules

- Rank models independently for Chat, Writing, and Summarization.
- Never inherit writing evidence from coding, tool-use, or generic chat tests.
- Never inherit evidence across a different artifact digest, quantization, provider, operating system, or execution-host hardware profile.
- A missing recommended model may be offered for explicit, disclosed installation; Haven 42 must not download it automatically.
- An installed unknown model remains `unverified`. It may be user-selected for bounded text generation, but it cannot become the automatic default or gain tools, filesystem access, repository writes, or external network authority.
- Promote a default only after its license and exact evidence pass. If no installed model qualifies, show `No validated model installed` instead of silently selecting the first provider result.
