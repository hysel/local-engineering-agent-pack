# Compatibility Notes

## Purpose

This document records compatibility expectations for Continue, local models, Ollama, MCP, and SonarQube-related workflows.

## Continue

The pack targets Continue YAML configuration with:

```yaml
schema: v1
```

Compatibility expectations:

- Continue can load `.continue/config.yaml`.
- Local prompts, rules, agents, and templates are referenced by repository-relative paths.
- MCP remains optional and disabled by default.
- MCP workflows require Continue agent mode.

## Ollama And Local Models

Default model assumptions:

- Chat/edit/apply/tool workflows: `qwen3-coder:30b`
- Embeddings: `nomic-embed-text`

Expected local setup:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen3-coder:30b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Tool-use guidance:

- `qwen3-coder:30b` is the current validated default for Agent mode tool execution in the tested VSCodium, Continue, and Ollama setup.
- `qwen2.5-coder:7b` may still be useful as a lightweight chat or planning model, but it produced raw JSON tool-call text instead of executable tool calls in validation.
- When a model prints tool-call JSON instead of executing tools, use the runtime-context fallback workflow in `docs/troubleshooting.md`.

Endpoint guidance:

- Use Continue's default local Ollama behavior for committed config.
- Use custom `apiBase` values only as local machine overrides.
- Do not commit private IP addresses, local hostnames, VPN endpoints, or machine-specific ports.

## MCP

Default configuration:

```yaml
mcpServers: []
```

Compatibility expectations:

- The pack works without MCP.
- Optional MCP setup is documented separately.
- Local `stdio` MCP servers are preferred for first adoption.
- Remote MCP transports require additional security review.
- MCP-derived evidence should be identified separately in review output.

## SonarQube

Supported documentation targets:

- SonarQube Server
- SonarQube Community Build
- SonarQube Cloud

Compatibility expectations:

- Manual SonarQube triage works without API access.
- Web API automation uses environment variables and read-only access.
- SonarQube MCP remains optional until validated.
- SonarQube hostnames, project keys, organization keys, and tokens are not committed.

## Operating System

The pack is documentation and configuration heavy, so it should remain broadly portable.

Validated and documented command examples currently prefer PowerShell because this repository is maintained from a Windows workstation.

When adding commands:

- Prefer cross-platform commands where practical.
- Label shell-specific examples.
- Avoid paths that depend on one user's home directory.

## Line Endings

Git may report LF-to-CRLF normalization warnings on Windows.

These warnings do not automatically indicate a content problem, but contributors should avoid unrelated line-ending churn when editing files.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Continue loads `.continue/config.yaml`.
- [ ] Required prompt, rule, agent, and template files exist.
- [ ] Local Ollama models are available or documented as setup prerequisites.
- [ ] No committed machine-specific endpoint values are present.
- [ ] MCP remains disabled unless explicitly configured by the user.
- [ ] SonarQube guidance avoids committed secrets and private identifiers.
