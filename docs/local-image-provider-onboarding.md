# Local Image Provider Onboarding

`config/local-image-onboarding-contract.json` defines consumer-local image setup without requiring an external server. It is a planning and admission contract, not an installer and not evidence that untested native profiles work.

## Discovery And Selection

Discovery remains local and reports the operating system, architecture, system memory, available storage, accelerator vendor and model, usable dedicated or unified memory, and installed driver or runtime versions. Missing accelerator or memory evidence makes a profile unavailable; it must never silently select CPU execution.

Provider selection requires an exact operating-system and accelerator match. The validated Linux NVIDIA V100 ComfyUI/SDXL profile does not promote Windows NVIDIA, Windows Intel XPU, Windows AMD, Apple Silicon MPS, or any CPU profile.

## Consent Boundary

Before any download or filesystem change, onboarding must show the exact provider and model revision, license, source hosts, download and temporary-storage sizes, published checksums, destination locations, hardware fit, loopback exposure, artifact retention, provider-retained copies, cleanup, rollback, and uninstall behavior. Approval is single-use and bound to those exact effects.

A candidate-only profile produces an unavailable result and setup guidance. It cannot download a runtime, model, custom node, or installer. Custom nodes and external API nodes remain disabled unless separately promoted.

## Lifecycle And Promotion

A passing provider must start on demand, bind to `127.0.0.1`, confirm the intended accelerator, stop after a bounded idle period, and keep provider state outside the replaceable Haven 42 engine. Installation, health, model checksum, generation, PNG validation, metadata, cancellation, recovery, cleanup, update, rollback, and uninstall all belong to the exact profile gate.

The first native validation order remains Windows NVIDIA, Windows Intel XPU, Windows AMD, and finally Apple Silicon on a physical Mac. Failed profiles leave documentation only and ship no runtime or installer assets.
