# Approved Tool-Backed Changes

## Purpose

This guide explains how to let the assistant make changes in a project while keeping the user in control.

Use this after reading `docs/tool-use-modes.md`.

Use `docs/scoped-edits.md` when you are ready to convert an approved plan into small, reviewable file changes.

## Simple Rule

The assistant should not change files until the user clearly asks it to implement an approved change.

Good wording:

```text
Implement the approved plan. Keep the changes limited to the files needed for this task.
```

## Before You Start

Open the project you want to change.

Check git status:

```powershell
git status --short --branch
```

If there are uncommitted changes, decide whether they are yours and whether they should stay. The assistant should work around unrelated user changes and should not revert them.

Confirm read-only tools work before approving writes.

Safe test prompt:

```text
Use tools to list the repository files. Do not modify files.
```

Expected behavior:

- Continue shows a tool run or approval UI.
- The tool runs.
- The assistant returns a normal text response.

Do not continue to approved write mode if the assistant prints raw JSON tool calls instead of running tools.

Also confirm file-content reading works. Listing files alone is not enough for implementation.

Safe read-content prompt:

```text
Use tools to read README.md.
Do not modify files.
Return the first heading only.
If you cannot read the file, say READ_TOOLS_UNAVAILABLE.
```

Do not continue to approved write mode if the assistant cannot read real file contents.

Then confirm write tools work in a disposable branch or test repository.

Safe write smoke-test prompt:

```text
Use approved write mode for this smoke test only.

Create a file named continue-agent-write-test.md with exactly this content:

Continue Agent write test passed.

Do not modify any other files.
After editing, report the changed file and stop.
Do not commit.
```

Expected behavior:

- The assistant uses an edit/apply tool.
- The assistant does not ask you to create the file manually.
- `git status --short` shows only the smoke-test file.

On Windows, clean up with:

```powershell
Remove-Item .\continue-agent-write-test.md
```

On Linux or macOS, clean up with:

```bash
rm ./continue-agent-write-test.md
```

## Step 1: Start With Read-Only Review

Ask for discovery first:

```text
Review this project. Do not modify files. Explain the structure, risks, and likely affected areas.
```

The assistant may read files and inspect the project, but it should not edit anything.

## Step 2: Ask For A Plan

Ask for a plan before implementation:

```text
Create an implementation plan for this change. Do not write code yet.
```

The plan should include:

- Goal
- Current state
- Affected files or components
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- Risks
- Testing plan
- Rollback plan
- Definition of done

Do not approve implementation if the plan is too broad, unclear, or missing validation.

## Step 3: Approve The Change

When the plan looks right, approve the specific scope:

```text
Go ahead and implement this plan. Only change the files needed for this task.
```

For high-risk changes, be more specific:

```text
Implement steps 1 and 2 only. Do not change dependencies, config, authentication, or deployment files.
```

For a more controlled workflow, approve one plan slice at a time. See `docs/scoped-edits.md`.

## Step 4: Review What Changed

After implementation, check:

```powershell
git status --short
git diff --check
```

Then review the actual diff:

```powershell
git diff
```

The assistant should explain:

- Which files changed
- Why each change was needed
- What validation was run
- What still needs manual review

## Step 5: Validate

Use the validation that fits the project.

Common examples:

```powershell
dotnet test
dotnet build
npm test
npm run build
```

If no automated tests exist, ask for manual validation steps.

## Step 6: Commit Only When Ready

The assistant should not commit unless the user asks.

Good wording:

```text
Commit these changes with a clear message.
```

Push only when the user asks:

```text
Push the commit to the remote repository.
```

## Stop Or Roll Back

If the changes are wrong, stop and inspect first:

```powershell
git status --short
git diff
```

Do not run destructive reset commands unless you are sure you want to discard the work.

Safer options:

- Ask the assistant to explain the diff.
- Ask the assistant to undo only its own last change.
- Restore a single file manually if needed.
- Use a branch before risky work.

## What The Assistant May Change

After approval, the assistant may change:

- Files directly related to the approved task.
- Tests related to the changed behavior.
- Documentation related to the changed behavior.
- Configuration only when the plan explicitly includes it.

## What Needs Extra Approval

Ask again before:

- Deleting files.
- Moving or renaming files.
- Changing dependencies.
- Changing authentication or authorization.
- Changing deployment, release, or CI behavior.
- Formatting unrelated files.
- Committing.
- Pushing.

## Sample Safe Flow

Use this sequence for most projects:

```text
Review this project. Do not modify files.
```

```text
Create an implementation plan for adding this feature. Do not write code yet.
```

```text
Implement the approved plan. Keep changes scoped.
```

```text
Explain the diff and tell me what validation you ran.
```

```text
Commit the changes.
```

## Local Configuration Safety

Do not commit:

- Private IP addresses.
- Local machine paths.
- Tokens or passwords.
- Personal model endpoint overrides.
- Raw private repository output.

Keep local settings in ignored files such as `.continue/config.local.yaml`.
