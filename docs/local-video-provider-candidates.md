## Evaluation Order And Admission Decision

HunyuanVideo 1.5 and Wan2.2 require separate Linux NVIDIA evaluations for text-to-video and image-to-video. LTX-2.3 remains deferred until suitable 32 GB-class VRAM and storage are available. Every run must verify accelerator use, duration, resolution, frame rate/count, codec/container decoding, non-empty frames, cancellation, timeout, restart, retained state, cleanup, rollback, and uninstall.

Windows NVIDIA is a separate native profile. Windows Intel, Windows AMD, and Apple Silicon remain unavailable until a credible exact provider path passes. The identity, likeness, reference-media, generated-content, and commercial-use controls are defined in `docs/generative-media-consent-policy.md`.
