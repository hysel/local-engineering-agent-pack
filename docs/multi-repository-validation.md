# Multi-Repository Validation

## Purpose

Use this guide to validate the pack against more than one repository shape.

The goal is to prove that the prompts, rules, install scripts, model guidance,
and tool-use guardrails work across realistic projects without committing
private code, local paths, endpoints, raw transcripts, or customer details.

## Repository Categories

Track coverage by repository category instead of by private repository name.

Recommended categories:

| Category | What to validate |
| --- | --- |
| Legacy .NET or .NET Framework | Project discovery, dependency migration planning, config handling, and conservative modernization guidance. |
| Modern .NET or ASP.NET Core | Clean Architecture, API, security, testing, logging, and performance review behavior. |
| Documentation or configuration pack | Repository-type classification, setup docs, validation scripts, and non-application recommendations. |
| Frontend application | Repository discovery, package/tooling awareness, test guidance, and scoped edits. |
| Script or tooling repository | Cross-platform commands, install/update instructions, validation scripts, and shell safety. |

Add new categories only when they represent a meaningfully different project
shape or risk profile.

## Minimum Validation Flow

For each repository category:

1. Start from a clean git working tree.
2. Install or update the pack with the documented installer.
3. Confirm Continue is using the intended config.
4. Run repository discovery in read-only mode.
5. Run implementation planning in plan-only mode.
6. Run one review workflow that matches the repository type.
7. If tools are required, run read-content validation before approved writes.
8. If approved writes are required, run the approved-write smoke test first.
9. Verify any claimed changes with external shell or git commands.
10. Run deterministic output verification for generated workflow outputs.
11. Record sanitized evidence with `examples/multi-repository-validation.md`.

When additional real repositories are not available, create local sample repositories for representative categories. Generated samples should contain realistic file names, minimal source/configuration files, and no private code or endpoints.

Do not skip the clean-tree check. It is the easiest way to avoid mixing pack
validation with unrelated user changes.

## Milestone 13 Completion Basis

Milestone 13 is complete when the pack has sanitized evidence for at least three repository categories and the validation workflow itself is documented, tested, and reusable.

Current completion evidence combines:

- Legacy .NET real-category validation recorded in `docs/runtime-validation.md`.
- Generated Python and TypeScript sample evidence recorded in `examples/sample-repository-factory-validation.md`.
- Generated Node, Java, Go, Rust, Infrastructure as Code, and SQL sample-category evidence recorded in `examples/sample-repository-factory-validation.md`.

Generated samples are acceptable for the milestone coverage target when additional real repositories are unavailable. They do not replace future real-repository evidence expansion, and they do not prove editor approved-write readiness by themselves.

## What To Record

Record only reusable, sanitized evidence:

- Repository category.
- Repository size bucket, such as small, medium, or large.
- Primary language or framework family.
- Editor surface, Continue version, model, and provider.
- Operating system.
- Whether MCP was enabled.
- Prompts tested.
- Tool-use status.
- Pass/fail result.
- Failure signals.
- Follow-up changes made to this pack.

Do not record:

- private repository names.
- Private file paths.
- Private endpoints or IP addresses.
- Usernames, hostnames, tokens, or secrets.
- Raw source code.
- Raw model transcripts.
- Customer, employer, or internal project identifiers.

## Pass Criteria

A validation run passes when:

- The assistant classifies the repository type correctly.
- The assistant uses actual repository evidence instead of generic advice.
- The assistant respects read-only and plan-only boundaries.
- Any tool use matches the active operating system and shell.
- Any approved write is scoped, externally verified, and reversible.
- Sensitive information is not copied into committed pack documentation.

## Failure Signals

Use the existing failure labels where possible:

- `READ_TOOLS_UNAVAILABLE`
- `WRITE_TOOLS_UNAVAILABLE`
- `WRITE_NOT_APPLIED`
- `PATH_AMBIGUOUS`
- `WORKSPACE_UNAVAILABLE`
- `APPLY_TARGET_MISMATCH`
- `DUPLICATE_APPROVALS`
- `DUPLICATE_CONTENT`
- `RAW_TOOL_CALL_OUTPUT`
- `THINK_TAG_LEAK`

Add a short plain-language note when a new failure mode appears. Convert
repeated failure modes into prompt, rule, documentation, or script changes.

## Updating Shared Guidance

Use this decision path after each validation run:

1. If the issue is caused by one repository only, keep it in sanitized evidence.
2. If the issue affects a project category, update docs or prompts.
3. If the issue affects install, validation, model selection, or tooling, add a
   test before changing behavior.
4. If the issue affects private environment setup only, document the pattern
   without committing private endpoints, paths, or names.
