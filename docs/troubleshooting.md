# Troubleshooting

## Purpose

Use this guide when the Continue Enterprise Engineering Pack does not load, prompts do not appear, or local model execution fails.

## Quick Checks

Run these checks from the repository root:

```powershell
git status --short --branch
Test-Path .continue/config.yaml
npx -y @continuedev/cli --help
```

If using Ollama locally:

```powershell
ollama list
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:11434/ -Method Get
```

If using Ollama on another host, replace the URL with your local override endpoint.

## Continue Config Does Not Load

Symptoms:

- Continue reports a config parsing error.
- Continue cannot find `.continue/config.yaml`.
- CLI output includes `ENOENT`.

Checks:

```powershell
Test-Path .continue/config.yaml
npx -y @continuedev/cli --config .continue/config.yaml --readonly -p "Reply OK"
```

Fixes:

- Run the command from the repository root.
- Use an absolute config path if relative resolution is unclear.
- Check YAML indentation.
- Confirm `name`, `version`, and `schema` are present.

For editor-specific checks in VS Code or VSCodium, use `docs/editor-compatibility.md`.

## `cn` Is Not Recognized

Symptoms:

- PowerShell reports `cn: The term 'cn' is not recognized`.

Meaning:

The Continue CLI global command is not installed on `PATH`.

Checks:

```powershell
Get-Command cn -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npx @continuedev/cli --version
```

Fixes:

- Use the CLI through `npx`:

```powershell
npx @continuedev/cli --config .continue/config.yaml
```

- Or install the CLI globally:

```powershell
npm install -g @continuedev/cli
```

After global installation, close and reopen PowerShell before retrying `cn`.

## Local File References Do Not Resolve

Symptoms:

- Rules or prompts are missing.
- Continue loads the config but expected workflows are unavailable.

Checks:

```powershell
$base = Resolve-Path .continue
$refs = Select-String -Path .continue\config.yaml -Pattern 'uses: file://(.+)$' | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches[0].Groups[1].Value }
$missing = @()
foreach ($ref in $refs) {
  if ($ref.StartsWith('./')) {
    $path = Join-Path $base $ref.Substring(2)
  } else {
    $path = $ref
  }
  if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $path)) {
    $missing += $path
  }
}
$missing
```

Fixes:

- Keep referenced prompt and rule files under `.continue`.
- Use lower-case kebab-case filenames for prompts.
- Keep `file://./...` references aligned with paths relative to `.continue/config.yaml`.

## Windows Absolute `file://` Paths Fail

Symptoms:

- Continue reports paths such as `C:\C:\path\to\project`.
- Continue reports duplicated path segments such as `prompts\prompts`.
- Continue reports `ENOENT` for files that exist.

Meaning:

Some Windows and VSCodium setups may resolve `file:///C:/...` incorrectly.

Fixes:

- Use this local-only Windows path style:

```yaml
uses: file://C:/Users/your-user/source/your-project/.continue/prompts/repository-discovery.md
```

- Avoid this style if it produces `C:\C:\...` paths:

```yaml
uses: file:///C:/Users/your-user/source/your-project/.continue/prompts/repository-discovery.md
```

- Keep these absolute paths out of committed shared config.

## Duplicate Rules

Symptoms:

- Continue reports duplicate rules with names such as `API Design`, `.NET Engineering`, `Security`, or `Testing`.

Common causes:

- The same rules are loaded from both the default user config and the workspace `.continue` folder.
- Backup or disabled config files still end in `.yaml`.
- The workspace has more than one active config file.

Fixes:

- Keep only one active config source for rules.
- If the default user config references workspace rules, remove or rename workspace config files so they do not end in `.yaml`.
- If Continue auto-loads `.continue/rules`, remove the explicit `rules:` block from the default user config.
- Rename local backup files to extensions such as `.bak` instead of `.yaml`.

Useful checks:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "$env:USERPROFILE\.continue" -Force -File -Filter "*.yaml"
Get-ChildItem ".continue" -Force -File -Filter "*.yaml"
Select-String -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.continue\config.yaml" -Pattern "^rules:|file://.*rules"
```

## Agent Mode Prints JSON Tool Calls

Symptoms:

- Agent mode prints output like:

```json
{"name":"ls","arguments":{"dirPath":".","recursive":true}}
```

- Clicking Apply returns `could not resolve filepath to apply changes`.

Meaning:

The model produced a tool-call-shaped JSON message, but Continue did not execute it as a tool call. The JSON is not a patch and should not be applied.

Fixes:

- Do not click Apply on raw JSON tool-call text.
- Confirm the Continue surface is Agent mode.
- Try a stronger or more tool-compatible model.
- Use `@Files`, selected text, active-file context, or a generated runtime context file as a fallback.

Fallback:

Windows:

```powershell
$Pack = "C:\path\to\continue-enterprise-engineering-pack"
& "$Pack\scripts\generate-runtime-context.ps1" -TargetRepo (Get-Location).Path -OutputPath .\runtime-context.md
```

Linux:

```bash
PACK="/path/to/continue-enterprise-engineering-pack"
"$PACK/scripts/generate-runtime-context.linux.sh" --target-repo "$PWD" --output-path ./runtime-context.md
```

macOS:

```bash
PACK="/path/to/continue-enterprise-engineering-pack"
"$PACK/scripts/generate-runtime-context.macos.sh" --target-repo "$PWD" --output-path ./runtime-context.md
```

Then attach `runtime-context.md` with `@Files` and ask the model not to use tools or output JSON.

## Ollama Is Not Reachable

Symptoms:

- Continue returns `Connection error`.
- `ollama` is not found on `PATH`.
- `127.0.0.1:11434` does not accept connections.

Checks:

```powershell
Get-Command ollama -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 127.0.0.1 -Port 11434
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:11434/ -Method Get
```

Fixes:

- Start Ollama.
- Install Ollama if it is missing.
- Confirm the configured model exists with `ollama list`.
- If Ollama runs on another host, use a local `apiBase` override for testing. Do not commit private network addresses.

## Model Is Missing

Symptoms:

- Continue loads the config but model execution fails.
- Ollama reports that the model is not found.

Checks:

```powershell
ollama list
```

Example models:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen3:14b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Fixes:

- Pull the missing model.
- Use `docs/local-model-selection.md` or `--auto-model-config` to choose a local model for your machine.
- Keep machine-specific model experiments out of committed config unless they are intended defaults.

## Prompts Do Not Appear

Symptoms:

- A prompt file exists but is not invokable.
- Continue does not show a configured workflow.

Checks:

- Confirm the prompt is referenced in `.continue/config.yaml`.
- Confirm frontmatter starts on the first line.
- Confirm `name`, `description`, and `invokable: true` are present.
- Confirm the filename matches the config reference.

Fixes:

- Normalize prompt frontmatter.
- Use lower-case kebab-case prompt names.
- Rerun Continue after changing config or prompt files.

## Rules Do Not Seem To Apply

Symptoms:

- Assistant output ignores expected standards.
- Review output does not reflect `.continue/rules`.

Checks:

- Confirm each rule is referenced in `.continue/config.yaml`.
- Confirm rule frontmatter starts on the first line.
- Confirm the rule is broad and reusable rather than too task-specific.

Fixes:

- Make the relevant prompt explicitly reference the rule conceptually.
- Keep rule language concise and enforceable.
- Add an example output that demonstrates the expected behavior.

## Remote Ollama Endpoint Overrides

The committed config should remain portable and should not include private IP addresses.

For local testing, users may add an `apiBase` value to their local working copy:

```yaml
apiBase: http://your-ollama-host:11434
```

Before committing, verify private addresses are not included:

```powershell
rg -n "apiBase|192\.168\.|10\.|172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1])\."
```

## Git Shows Line Ending Warnings

Symptoms:

- Git reports `LF will be replaced by CRLF`.

Meaning:

This is usually a Windows line-ending warning, not a content failure.

Checks:

```powershell
git diff --check
```

Fixes:

- Treat `git diff --check` errors as actionable.
- Treat plain LF-to-CRLF warnings as informational unless the repository adopts stricter line-ending rules.

## Validation Before Committing

Run:

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git diff --check
```

Then verify:

- No private endpoints are committed.
- `.continue/config.yaml` has the intended version.
- Local `file://` references resolve.
- README, ROADMAP, TODO, and CHANGELOG match the actual state.
