# Editor Compatibility

## Purpose

Use this guide to test whether Continue is using this pack correctly in VS Code, VSCodium, or the Continue CLI.

The pack should stay editor-neutral. The committed `.continue/config.yaml` should work as a project-local config, while editor-specific paths, private endpoints, and local model experiments stay in local-only config files.

## Supported Surfaces

| Surface | What to expect | What to verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VS Code | Usually installs extensions from Microsoft's Marketplace. | Continue can load the project-local `.continue/config.yaml`, show the configured model, and run prompts. |
| VSCodium | Usually installs extensions from Open VSX. Extension versions and command names may differ from VS Code. | Continue can load the project-local `.continue/config.yaml`, show the configured model, and run prompts without duplicate global rules. |
| Continue CLI | Useful fallback when editor behavior is unclear. | `npx @continuedev/cli --config .continue/config.yaml` can load the same config. |

## Project-Local Config Rule

After installing this pack into a target repository, use the target repository's config:

```text
target-repository/
  .continue/
    config.yaml
```

Do not keep pointing Continue at the original pack repository after copying the pack into the project you want to review.

Keep local machine settings in ignored files such as:

```text
.continue/config.local.yaml
```

Do not commit:

- private Ollama endpoints
- local filesystem paths
- private model names
- tokens or API keys
- editor-specific absolute config paths

## Setup Checks

Run these checks before testing prompts:

1. Open the target repository in the editor.
2. Confirm the editor file explorer shows the target repository files.
3. Confirm the target repository has `.continue/config.yaml`.
4. Confirm Continue shows the expected local model.
5. Confirm prompts such as `repository-discovery`, `implementation-plan`, and `code-review` are visible.
6. Confirm duplicate-rule warnings are not present.

If the model or prompts are missing, Continue may be using a global/default config instead of the project-local config.

## Duplicate Rule Warnings

Duplicate rule warnings usually mean the same rule files are loaded from two places:

- global Continue config
- project-local `.continue/config.yaml`

Common warning examples:

```text
Duplicate rules named "API Design" detected.
Duplicate rules named "Clean Architecture" detected.
Duplicate rules named "Security" detected.
```

Fix:

1. Choose one active source of rules.
2. Prefer the project-local `.continue/config.yaml` for repositories using this pack.
3. Remove or disable duplicate rule entries from the global Continue config.
4. Reload the editor window.
5. Reopen Continue and confirm the warnings are gone.

## Read-Only Editor Test

Use this first test in VS Code or VSCodium:

```text
Run repository discovery for this project.
Do not modify files.

Identify:
1. The project type
2. The major files and folders
3. The current architecture
4. The main risks
5. The suggested next steps
```

Expected result:

- The response references real files from the opened repository.
- The response does not say it lacks filesystem access.
- The response does not print raw JSON tool calls as the final answer.
- No files are modified.

## Agent Tool Test

Only run this after the read-only editor test works.

Use Agent mode and ask:

```text
List the top-level files in this repository.
Do not modify files.
Summarize what each important file is for.
```

Expected result:

- Continue executes a read/list tool or otherwise inspects the opened repository.
- The final answer summarizes actual files.
- The final answer does not only print tool-call JSON such as `{"name":"ls","arguments":...}`.

If Agent mode prints raw JSON instead of executing tools, treat that model/editor setup as not tool-validated. Use runtime context fallback from `docs/runtime-validation.md` or switch to a model already validated for tool use.

## CLI Fallback

Use the CLI fallback when the editor does not clearly show which config is active.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
npx -y @continuedev/cli --config .continue/config.yaml --readonly -p "Reply OK"
```

Linux or macOS:

```bash
npx -y @continuedev/cli --config .continue/config.yaml --readonly -p "Reply OK"
```

If the CLI loads the config but the editor does not, the issue is likely editor config selection, extension version, or global config precedence.

## Test Record

When testing an editor surface, record:

- editor name: VS Code or VSCodium
- editor version
- Continue extension version
- operating system
- model name
- provider: Ollama, OpenAI-compatible local endpoint, or other
- whether `.continue/config.yaml` loaded
- whether duplicate-rule warnings appeared
- whether read-only repository discovery worked
- whether Agent mode executed tools
- whether any fallback was needed

Keep private endpoints, usernames, local paths, private repository names, and raw transcripts out of committed notes.
