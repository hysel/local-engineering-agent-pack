# MCP Options Research

## Purpose

This document evaluates Model Context Protocol options for Haven 42.

The goal is to identify useful MCP integrations without compromising the pack's local-first posture, portability, or compatibility with Ollama-backed systems.

## Current Recommendation

Do not enable MCP servers by default in `.continue/config.yaml`.

Instead:

- Keep `mcpServers: []` in the default config.
- Document MCP as optional.
- Prefer local `stdio` MCP servers for first adoption.
- Treat GitHub and SonarQube MCP integrations as opt-in because they require credentials, network access, and stronger security review.
- Keep the pack fully usable with local Ollama and no MCP.

## Why Optional MCP

MCP can give Continue access to external tools, systems, and repositories, but each server expands the trust boundary. For this local-first pack, the safest default is to keep the base configuration local-first and add integrations only when the user explicitly chooses them.

Continue supports MCP through `mcpServers`, and MCP works in agent mode. MCP servers can use local `stdio` transport or remote HTTP-style transports. Remote transports are useful, but they introduce additional network and authentication concerns.

## Local Ollama Compatibility

MCP does not require a cloud model.

The pack should continue to work with:

- Local Ollama on `127.0.0.1`
- Local-network Ollama endpoints used as machine-local overrides
- Self-hosted model endpoints
- No MCP servers enabled

Local model compatibility requirements:

- Do not require cloud-hosted LLMs for MCP workflows.
- Do not commit machine-specific model endpoints.
- Do not require GitHub, SonarQube, or internet access for core prompts.
- Keep repository discovery, planning, reviews, and examples usable without MCP.

## Candidate MCP Integrations

### Filesystem Or Repository Context

Use case:

- Read local files.
- Search project content.
- Inspect repository structure.

Recommendation:

- Defer for now.
- Continue already provides file, code, diff, and terminal context providers in this pack.
- Add a filesystem MCP only if it provides clear value beyond existing Continue context.

Security notes:

- Limit directory access to the active workspace.
- Do not grant access to the full user profile or system drive.
- Avoid write-capable filesystem tools by default.

### GitHub Context

Use case:

- Review pull requests.
- Inspect issues.
- Search repository metadata.
- Connect review workflows to GitHub discussion context.

Recommendation:

- Recommended as the first external MCP candidate, but opt-in only.
- Prefer GitHub's official MCP server or managed endpoint over deprecated community packages.
- Limit toolsets to the smallest set needed, such as repositories, issues, and pull requests.

Security notes:

- Use least-privilege tokens.
- Prefer fine-grained GitHub tokens.
- Never commit tokens or token examples with real values.
- Do not enable write-capable tools until read-only workflows are proven.

### SonarQube Context

Use case:

- Pull quality gate status.
- Inspect vulnerabilities, bugs, code smells, and coverage.
- Link findings to review workflows.

Recommendation:

- Keep manual paste/export workflow as the supported path for now.
- Research API or MCP integration separately.
- Do not add SonarQube MCP until authentication, authorization, and data sensitivity are documented.

Security notes:

- SonarQube findings may expose sensitive implementation details.
- Tokens should be scoped to read-only project analysis.
- Avoid exposing private project keys or internal hostnames in committed examples.

### Issue Tracker Or Project Management Context

Use case:

- Connect implementation planning to tickets, acceptance criteria, and release scope.

Recommendation:

- Not a first integration.
- Defer until GitHub and SonarQube paths are clear.

Security notes:

- Issue trackers often contain customer data, incident details, and private business context.
- Require explicit opt-in and data-handling guidance.

## Recommended First Path

1. Keep default config unchanged with `mcpServers: []`.
2. Add `docs/mcp-setup.md` with optional MCP setup guidance.
3. Start with a read-only GitHub MCP profile.
4. Document required environment variables and permissions.
5. Validate with local Ollama before recommending the integration.
6. Keep SonarQube MCP/API integration as a separate research task.

## Suggested Optional Config Shape

Example only. Do not add this to the default config until the integration is selected and validated.

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: GitHub
    type: stdio
    command: docker
    args:
      - run
      - -i
      - --rm
      - -e
      - GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
      - ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Continue loads the config with MCP disabled.
- [ ] Continue still works with local Ollama and no internet access for core workflows.
- [ ] Optional MCP setup is documented separately from the default config.
- [ ] Required secrets are environment-based and never committed.
- [ ] MCP tools are read-only where possible.
- [ ] MCP server permissions are scoped to the smallest useful surface.
- [ ] Prompt output identifies MCP-derived context separately from repository-local evidence.

## Decision

MCP support should be optional and documented, not enabled by default.

First candidate: GitHub MCP for read-only repository, issue, and pull request context.

Deferred:

- Filesystem MCP, because Continue already has local file/code/diff context.
- SonarQube MCP/API integration, pending separate integration research.
- Issue tracker integrations, pending stronger data-handling guidance.
