# Agent Surface Solutions

`config/agent-surface-solutions.json` is the user-facing solution catalog for agent surfaces.

It answers the same three questions for every surface:

- How do I install it?
- How do I configure it?
- How do I test it?

The catalog does not make planned or blocked surfaces look ready. It records the current solution, status, evidence, and blocked reason for each agent.

It also records the config-bundle policy. Continue is the only supported generated bundle today; future surface-specific bundles are gated by `docs/surface-specific-config-bundles.md`.

## Current Summary

| Surface | Install | Configure | Test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Continue | supported | supported | validated |
| Cline | planned | planned | validated |
| Aider | scaffolded | planned | validated |
| Roo Code | planned | planned | scaffolded |
| Kilo Code | planned | planned | scaffolded |
| OpenCode | planned | planned | scaffolded |
| OpenHands | blocked | blocked | planned |

## Rules

- Every surface must define install, configure, and test.
- Every activity must include a status, solution, workflow list, evidence list, and blocked reason field.
- Workflow IDs must exist in `config/workflows.json`.
- Evidence paths must be repository-relative and sanitized.
- Shared workflows can support many surfaces only when they do not assume a surface-specific configuration format.
- Surface-specific config bundles must follow `docs/surface-specific-config-bundles.md`.
- Planned and blocked surfaces must not be promoted by docs, menus, dashboards, or recommendation output.

## How To Use It

Start with `docs/agent-pack-menu.md` for the short user menu.

Use this solution catalog when you need to compare agent surfaces or decide what work remains before a surface can be promoted from planned/scaffolded to supported or validated.

Use `docs/script-reference-appendix.md` for direct command details after you choose a workflow.
