# Agent Surface Promotion Gates

This document defines what a non-Continue agent surface must prove before the pack can promote install, configure, test, or approved-write support.

Continue remains the supported first path. Other surfaces can move forward only with sanitized evidence recorded in `config/evidence-catalog.tsv`, `config/agent-surface-solutions.json`, and a surface-specific evidence document.

## Milestone 17 Cline And Aider Completion Basis

Milestone 17 has complete Cline and Aider evidence for the current documented scope because at least one non-Continue surface has sanitized read-only validation evidence, Cline has disposable write-smoke evidence, Aider has generated-sample read-only, write-smoke, and scoped-edit evidence, and real-project approved-write remains blocked until explicit non-generated repository validation passes.

Milestone 17 remains partial for full tracked-surface compatibility because Roo Code, Kilo Code, OpenCode, and OpenHands do not yet have full live validation evidence.

Roo Code, Kilo Code, and OpenCode remain future live-validation targets because their real command shapes or install/config behavior must be confirmed before generated-sample wrapper validation can be treated as surface evidence.

## Shared Gates

| Gate | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Candidate tracked | Surface name, operating mode, expected local model path, and reason it fits the pack. |
| Read-only validated | The surface discovers the opened repository, lists files, reads specific files, and produces grounded output without modifying files. |
| Plan validated | The surface produces a plan that passes deterministic filename, rollback, test, and unsupported-claim checks. |
| Write smoke validated | The surface changes one minimal file in a disposable repository and passes external `git status`, `git diff --check`, and direct file-content verification. |
| Scoped edit validated | The surface changes only expected source/test files in a generated or disposable repository and passes external behavior verification. |
| Install supported | The install path is repeatable, documented, dry-run safe where possible, and does not assume private machine state. |
| Configure supported | The local model config format is documented, generated output is local-only, and private endpoints stay out of committed files. |
| Approved-write ready | Read-only, plan, smoke, and scoped-edit gates pass for the intended surface, model, OS, and permission mode. |

## Surface-Specific Next Gates

| Surface | Current position | Next gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cline | Read-only and minimal disposable write-smoke evidence exists. | Realistic scoped edit against a generated sample with external changed-file and behavior verification. |
| Aider | CLI read-only, disposable write-smoke, and richer generated-sample scoped edits exist. | Explicitly approved non-generated repository validation before real-project approved-write claims. |
| Roo Code | Shared wrapper scaffold exists. | Confirm real command shape, then run read-only generated-sample validation. |
| Kilo Code | Shared wrapper scaffold exists. | Confirm real command shape, then run read-only generated-sample validation. |
| OpenCode | Shared wrapper scaffold exists. | Confirm CLI install/config behavior, then run read-only generated-sample validation. |
| OpenHands | Platform-agent candidate is blocked for install/config generation. | Define workspace, sandbox, credential, and mounted-repository boundaries before any pack automation. |

## Promotion Rules

- Do not promote `install.status` or `configure.status` to `supported` without install/config evidence for that surface.
- Do not promote `test.status` to `validated` without a repeatable harness or documented manual validation path.
- Do not promote real-project approved-write support from generated-sample evidence alone.
- Do not reuse Continue config-generation status for another surface.
- Keep private endpoints, usernames, local paths, tokens, private repositories, and raw transcripts out of committed evidence.

## Evidence Update Checklist

- Update `config/evidence-catalog.tsv`.
- Update `config/agent-surface-solutions.json`.
- Update `docs/agent-surface-solutions.md` if the summary status changes.
- Update the relevant surface evidence doc or example.
- Run `scripts/test-pack.ps1`.
